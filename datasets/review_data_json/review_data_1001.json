I've been through similar struggles before and I'm even currently going through that same identity struggle. One of the great aspects of the show that I can't stress enough is it's authenticity. While these struggles obviously don't portray what every Muslim goes through, I have been able to relate to most of the aspects of the show through either past experiences I've been through myself or through someone else I know. From the struggles that Ramy personally experiences, or the struggles that his sister and parents deal with, they all show a truth that many of us have lived with and it's refreshing seeing this accurate depiction.<br/><br/>The show is obviously controversial, as it deals with the struggles a Muslim might face while trying to balance beliefs and desires. I think it deals well with the controversy by not shying away from it. Not everyone might like the way that a Muslim might be portrayed but I think it does well in showing this other side of faith and having to deal with that struggle, and that even the most devout Muslims should be able to empathize with.<br/><br/>Regardless, the show is extremely well done. Everyone's acting on the show is beyond incredible, and goes to show the insane amount of talent that a lot of these actors have, even characters with minor roles. The writing is a bit iffy at times, but it still does an overall incredible job and provides a perfect mix of comedy while still keeping true to the purpose of the show in beautifully showing Ramy's identity struggle. Loved the soundtrack as well!<br/><br/>Before watching the show I was a bit skeptical at how it would turn out, but I have been incredibly surprised. It's amazing that there's finally a show that deals with the life of a Middle Eastern person living in the 'West'. All in all though, this isn't a great show because it's the first of its kind.

Arquette's performance is understated, that of a likable character with an offbeat, supportive husband, cute kids, and a bizarre relationship with the spirit world. The guest cast tends towards the quirky, making them interesting. Allison's visions are more focused than the rather far-fetched images the young woman gets on \"Missing,\" probably because Allison is not only seeing, but talking to, dead people.", "rating": null, "helpful": "28 out of 42 found this helpful.", "date": "5 March 2005"}, {"title": " it's not as far fetched as the premise may seem", "content": "I've known women who have had premonitions - one even gets weird twinklings where she blurts out things while watching the news - and then whatever info she states comes out to be true.<br/><br/>So this show really works for me.

In doing so they have made the fantastic seem much more plausible and have given the show a sturdy foundation.<br/><br/>If you are looking for refreshingly crisp dialogue and some excellent acting within a show that makes you think, then please give Medium a try.

They interact in a way that reeks of verisimilitude and what we all HOPE could be marital communications. Joe is a little bit too adoring of his wife, Alison du Bois.

Our fascination with psychics had been a long one going back to people like Edgar Cayce and Jeanne Dixon and moving forward at the time with John Edwards. This series renewed that interest and took as its basis the real life story of psychic Allison DuBois, a psychic who has aided the police on several occasions.<br/><br/>Patricia Arquette stars as DuBois in the series. Having grown up with these abilities but never applying them she tries to lead a normal life living in Phoenix with her husband Joe (Jake Weber) and their three daughters (Sofia Vassilieva, Maria Lark and Madison and Miranda Carabello). Allison becomes an intern working for Phoenix District Attorney Manuel Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) and while working for him has a dream about a murder case taking place in Texas. Now the problem is how does she convince the law enforcement people she works with that her visions are legitimate not to mention convincing her husband as well? Of course she does eventually get them to follow up on the clues she can provide and bad guys are caught. In the course of these events her abilities are accepted and she helps with more cases than ever.<br/><br/>The thing is if they never accepted her abilities there wouldn't have been a series worth of stories to tell and especially a series that lasted 7 seasons. And as a viewer you have to believe that the crime in Phoenix would become non-existent with the way the DA and his team rely on her abilities more and more often as it progresses. Plus they have to convince anyone in other police departments in other cities of her abilities when she dreams about those locations.<br/><br/>But this is television. We want to believe, we want to be entertained and we want to hope that someone out there like this can help put bad guys away behind bars. With the crime statistics in this country it would seem a never ending battle. But again that doesn't matter as long as the show can be entertaining and this one was.<br/><br/>Arquette comes off as an everyday mom who has had these visions all her life but who has finally found a way to apply them to help others. At the same time it's not just helping solve crimes that goes on here. She's making lunches for her kids, dropping them off at school and dealing with their day to day issues as well. She has to comfort her husband when the need arises and the pair here on screen present a loving couple that deals with the same issues we all do on a daily basis be it bills or bullies or gossip mongers. Arquette's performance here brings the character to life in all of these circumstances.<br/><br/>Weber does a great job as well as the beleaguered husband who at first doesn't believe and yet learns that what she claims is true. And with the dreams and visions she has being those involving murder and mayhem he's the solid base she needs to stay grounded. Weber's portrayal of that supportive spouse is well done here. Even more so when it turns out that their three daughters also are in the midst of developing the same psychic connections.<br/><br/>While the series did well enough when it was on it was often up against some of the stiffest competition there was. It battled against the CBS juggernaut that was the CSI franchise in one form or another, the hottest shows on at the time. It later found itself up against LOST and the phenomena that that was and then LAW &amp; ORDER: SVU but it carried on. The series lasted 5 seasons on NBC and then shifted over to CBS for 2 more seasons before finally calling it quits.<br/><br/>This box set contains all 7 seasons for fans to go back and enjoy all over again. And if you never got around to watching any more than occasional episode you can now join in from the start and follow through to the last episode.

Glen Gordon Caron has been on the other side of the camera for a very long time, with a pedigree that includes, oh, for example, discovering Bruce Willis. And that's just for starters. Similarly, Arquette had a long and fairly impressive run in features, not always the A-roles, perhaps, but consistent nonetheless. Bringing these two together in 2005 was a match full of promise and ultimately the promise was kept. Next, the stories. It may be because the premise was based on a real person that the week-to-week plots were entirely consistent with the way real intuitives actually operate in the real world. Ordinarily Hollywood simply cannot resist the temptation to take it up a notch, especially from season to season. Had the plot arcs followed the usual Tinseltown roadmap, the Alison character played by Arquette would be getting predictive dreams in Season 1 and raising the dead by Season 6. But the producer showed restraint, and I believe that is part of the reason for the success of this show. I have seen every episode, and I recall that by the time the last season rolled around, they were getting just a tad frisky -- Alison may have a fatal illness, Alison's ability may be illegal in court; Alison tries to help Joe's business with her gift -- but a 6 year run is nothing to sneeze at.

I don't know how this list is created but if quality were a criteria then several hundred of these would be eliminated from consideration. Medium was excellent, I fell in love with the family in this show. The acting was excellent, to the point of feeling like I was part of it, Patricia Arquette won an Emmy award for her performance. I feel that other actors could have been considered as well. Joe (Jake Weber) was an excellent father/husband, the kids were also quit believable. I found myself being more interested in the family than the actual premise of the show. That is not to say that there was anything wrong with the storyline, the remaining cast were quite believable in their roles as well. Each show started with a mystery, usually through Alison's premonitions which drew you into the story from the very beginning. It's rare to find a show running 7 years where there aren't some bad episodes. I can't recall one that I didn't enjoy. Of course some were better than others but every one left me in anticipation of the next. Fortunately through the magic of Netflix I didn't have to wait. The problem I had was turning the TV off. In my opinion this was the best family dynamic I have personally seen on TV. I'll have to admit I'm not much of a TV series fan but that's because most of them are just not good enough to captivate me like this show did. I was genuinely disappointed when the show ended. That is very rare for me, usually by the time a show has been canceled I've grown tired of it anyway. Breaking Bad and Dexter may be the only other shows I can think of where I wanted more.

I think if you enjoyed the first season of Community you will almost certainly enjoy what I have seen so far of AP Bio. Of course Community ended up being so strong because secondary characters like Troy, Abed, and Annie as they developed became so awesome, and if AP Bio is to go anywhere then the student characters here will have to com into their own as well.

Still reeling from the reality series hostile takeover, I was un-amused by British tornado Chef Gordon Ramsey's blood-vessel bursting tantrums over food and sadistic treatment of his would-be chefs. A treatment that was a perfect metaphor for the way Fox was abusing it's own viewers.<br/><br/>But flash-forward to season 3 and Chef Gordon Ramsey and his team of inept contestants have grown on me. \"Hell's Kitchen\" is every bit a reality show and all that that implies. You've seen it before, but this time in a kitchen. Teams of chefs \u0096 divided by gender \"Apprentice\"-style \u0096 live in suites by night and compete in cooking tasks by day. Tasks like designing their own menu, cooking for an elementary school, turning traditional dishes into cuisine or blind taste tests of their palette. Each time a team looses, people are picked to eliminate and Ramsey picks one to be kicked off. And yes, like any reality/competition the most talented contestants are kicked off for something insignificant so that the most interesting personalities can be standing in the final rounds. No doubt, Ramsey is just as shrew about audience interest as Simon Cowell.<br/><br/>But there is a fiendishly entertaining bent to \"Kitchen\" that only Gordon Ramsey can deliver. A sadism to the high school reminiscent eliminations that is only bubbling cynically under the surface of other reality shows. When Ramsey eliminates people he tells them to \"f*** off\" then smacks their chef's jacket on a meat hook with a Leatherface-like zeal. It's hard to deny how entertaining it is watching Ramsey scream obscenities at the more inept contestants, shoving food in their face and putting together a string of expletives involving Risotto and Wellington so creative it demands an uncensored DVD release. The show does say a few things about the love and creativity of cooking, but that get pretty buried under it's hyper-sensory reality series excesses. Ramsey has taken this one-note act and spun it into quite a career.<br/><br/>This is not TV for the drive-by viewer looking for something to make them feel good after a day at work. It will be too stressful, too sweat-inducing, too claustrophobic and manipulative. Like any reality show it trusts the audience is stupid and is crammed with unnecessary narration and flashbacks of events we just saw 30 seconds ago. The cooking and elimination action is put together with the ridiculousness of an overblown Michael Bay film, and yet the \"world-is-at-stake\" action movie music and quick cuts to horrified faces doesn't fail to send up a giddy tickle of guilty pleasure entertainment in my belly.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised to see \"Hell's Kitchen\" on a list of the worst shows of the year by the HBO-loving, \"American Idol\" cow-towing media. But I'll take Ramsey's hysterical wrath on inept contestants over reality shows that reach further to mean something any day.

Great care was taken in the finales to feature the finalists' menus and managerial skills. The finalists were even responsible for designing their own dining rooms and choosing glassware, cutlery and pairing wines - really fleshing out their personalities and creativity for the audience to see. That all ended years ago, and it's unfortunate.<br/><br/>Since those first years, the show has felt more and more rushed. Production cuts have been evident, such as the axing of the 2-part season finales, and have hurt the product terribly.

The format is formulaic and predictable, and the contestant dramas feel contrived.<br/><br/>I've just watched the first episode of season 17 and I am already tapping out. It was advertised as an \"all-star\" season, which led me to believe that we were going to see a serious competition between the former runners-up, or 3rd place finishers at least. Not so. In a season where they INVITED these people to return and vie for a head chef job, they have purposely brought back loud-mouths, lazy folks, drama magnets and several who aren't even black jacket alumni. We're supposed to believe that Gordon, wanting to fill a head chef job at the new Hell's Kitchen restaurant, would make his first calls to some of these folks? Not evenly slightly realistic.<br/><br/>This \"all-star\" season consists of zero previous runners-up, about four 3rd place finishers, and everyone else is a 4th - 6th place finisher. Without explanation for this randomness, these choices cheapen the show and the new restaurant. It literally looks like a case of \"this is the best we could get\". What a shame. I was really hoping that this season could revitalize the competition aspect of this show, but that was not to be. In fact, it stands poised to do even more damage to the brand.

I would never allow myself to be at the mercy of Ramsey for any price, including my own restaurant (which the supposed 'winner' will be getting - whooptee doo).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the show is undeniably watchable, as has been noted by others here; part of it is gaping at how much abuse these poor schlubs are willing to put up with (and Ramsey, a Scorpio, has no limit to the level of sadism he can dish out), and part of it is watching the unbelievably petty ego stuff that's going on between the contestants and the ridiculously high jealousy level (for instance, with the long-suffering-but-still-noble Elsie getting to do the TV show in the last episode, before she was booted off). <br/><br/>I really don't care who wins, it's the human spectacle I'm intrigued with, sort of like how I used to find myself watching Jerry Springer's horrendous debacle every other night.<br/><br/>8/2 (a day after the Season Finale) - Here's the epitome of stupidity, boys and girls: after declaring Michael the Winner of his OWN RESTAURANT, Ramsey, in the midst of the celebration, asks Michael if he wants to come with him to London to work beside him, become a better chef, learn the tricks of the trade, blah blah blah. And guess what? Michael says yes. After going through all that torture just so he could get his own place, he agrees to go work with Ramsey in London instead. Doesn't this kind of negate the entire show? And questions remain: does Michael still get his restaurant? Does his girlfriend go to London with them? And most importantly, does Ramsey wind up getting tattoos over nearly every inch of his body?<br/><br/>6/25/06 - Started watching the second season, and I found myself thinking during the first episode of brutality that this series really shows the amazing gender double standard that still exists in this country. Can you imagine, for example, a reality series where a raging, foul-mouthed WOMAN shrieks, screams and viciously insults her charges for a hour each week, forcing them to work under the most hideous conditions known to the human race? And the charges in question not only submit to this endless torture, but they spend their evenings praying in their respective dungeons that they won't get kicked off, so they can endure more? What Ramsey gets away with here would never be even remotely accepted or acceptable if a woman did it, although, come to think of it, that would make a really funny SNL sketch, wouldn't it, with, say, Tina Fey in Ramsey's part.<br/><br/>7/17/07 - So now, we're well into season three of this deranged debacle, and the male contenders and Ramsey have taken to calling the female contenders \"Hell's Bitches\". Sounds like a supremely sellable spin-off to me, sort of like \"Charlie's Angels\" except they're armed with spatulas and cilantro instead. It would be a horror series, of course. Very much like this one.<br/><br/>Related notes: Ramsey Revisited ~ <br/><br/>I've been watching Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares, where in each episode he visits a different restaurant that's on the brink of disaster and works to revamp and revitalize it. Generally, there's always an ego problem at the core - the owner or the 'chef' usually - and it's a much gentler Ramsey who deals with these deluded freaks. Only in one episode did it actually dissolve into a yelling match (Ramsey won, of course, when the 'chef' slunk away licking his wounds, only to return with nothing but respect for Ramsey for finally putting him in his place). I have to say, I'm impressed with this version of Gordo, and I think he should use these more subtle tactics on Hell's Kitchen, which would make for a far more humane but equally watchable presentation.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "21 out of 50 found this helpful.", "date": "21 July 2005"}, {"title": " Love Gordon Ramsay but Terrible Show", "content": "I have watched Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and The F Word, and loved both of them.

The show gives this antique gore aptly, it's pretty good in the buildup and effect of the butchering is done with just the right tone. However, it's not just slashing away randomly, it also tries to set an eclectic cast. As the movie itself says, the audience should invest or care about the characters to make the killing efficient. <br/><br/>Characters are presentable, casting fresh actors is a good direction to build the series. They don't veer too much from typical high school kids, but there is effort to broaden the personalities beyond the expected. It uses already proved formula and tweaks it with modern upgrade without overflowing it to needlessly aggrandized aspects. <br/><br/>The main concern is how much the straightforward plot can carry it for many episodes. Its necessity to offer kills can also be taxing for a series and unlike movie sequel or reboot, the nostalgia effect will wear off sooner of latter. Luckily, it has room to expand and with enough mystery, it could work for the long run. <br/><br/>Serializing a slasher flick might have its issues, but Scream is clever enough to turn most of them into perks, making the classic kill fest into a more modern version and also staying true to its root. 7/10", "rating": 7, "helpful": "127 out of 161 found this helpful.", "date": "15 April 2016"}, {"title": " Should have never rebooted for Season 3", "content": "The first two seasons, with the exception of the last episode of Season 2, were excellent and well acted.

After he said that, and perfectly outlined the plot, I gave it a chance. And then promptly lost an entire night of sleep watching the first season.<br/><br/>This show is everything that made the old scream movies great, and then some. From the heart wrenching kills to the \"big reveal\", it will keep you enticed and enthralled. The show leads you to believe it's one character, before throwing evidence at other, and following it up with then clearing the latter. It got so good that I could tell who was the killer. I had probably 7 theories over the course of the first season, and 5 of them were proven wrong. The plot twists and sudden, and the kills are gruesome. Truly a classic slasher show.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the sequel. Season 3 was a surprise to me, who never reads descriptions of an episode before watching. And at first I was extremely skeptical. Sequels can often ruin a perfectly good movie. I felt like the token characters were shoehorned in with little regard for whether or not they would fit. But eventually they all settled into their right spots, and really brought out the story's themes of racism and secrecy. As soon as best girl Beth pointed out it was a sequel I changed my expectations from reboot, to sequel and everything fit better. Every character made more sense. And I must admit, I did not guess the killer correctly. But also I feel something more could've been brought into the show. More about the characters. I didn't feel for the characters in season 3 in the same way I felt for the first two seasons. And having grown up in the slums myself I should be able to relate to these public school breakfast club types. But I really think that was a lack of development on the side characters. Deion gets a lot of development, but the others kind of fall to the wayside.

Yea, it got inspiration from the source material but it stands on it's own. Secondly; don't mind the clich\u00e9s, they're meant to be there. Overall this is a fun comedy-horror/mystery with all the horror clich\u00e9s in the book, you love to see someone die because they're stupid!

But first let me mention Seasons 1 &amp; 2, as they were a guilty pleasure for me as well. But admittedly the first 2 seasons felt like a contrived &amp; serialized soap opera compared to the Scream legacy and what followed after. All the main characters, though I liked them, in season's 1 and 2 - majority had plot-armor and by the end some became too lovable to even be killed off. I enjoyed season 1 &amp; 2, but ended season 2 completely ready for what would come next. Season 3 was the reboot this show desperately needed. With out spoiling anything, my favorite character turned out to be the final killer, and I somehow did not see it coming at all until it had cornered me. Season 3 put this show back on track after the first 2 seasons were teetering a bit out of bounds. Season 3 felt more like a part of the Scream saga. and was a brilliant fresh take on the series. The first 2 or so episodes felt a bit rusty, but some how they managed to grapple with the story in a way that kept it churning. It kept me guessing and the 'whodunit' factor finally was a stronger part of the story. Like I said my favorite character turned out to be the killer with out me even seeing it coming. The red-herrings were well played. and the horror satire being turned at different angles was a pleasant surprise and true to form. I could not stop thinking about this show once it ended. I am over-hyping it a bit. But I just really dig a good whodunit slasher. and this one for what it was, was satisfying for me. Is it without flaws? Of course not. Is it perfect? Hell no. But it finally took this series somewhere else. and has kept this series alive for me. It makes the original (which I love, respect, and adore) almost look a bit paint-by-numbers now that the tropes are really all too common, and that is exactly what a Scream installment should do. A fun ride. and a welcome installment and achievement for those who were a part of it. I loved the cast as well. Still cannot shake off that ending reveal.

He was quoted as saying if he ended up in one more tight space with Greg Morris, he was going to wind up engaged! This was a show where the cast changes seemed to work pretty well, Graves, Leonard Nimoy, and Linda Day George especially.<br/><br/>I have so many favorite episodes. One was Cinnamon's involvement with Eric Braedon in the days when he was Hans Gundegast, the psychic one about the bees, the William Shatner back in time episode, the episode with Robert Conrad - there were so many. Later on in the show, the missions would go wrong and Graves or one of the others would have to improvise - that was great.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, the movies had nothing to do with this show.

Ranking a bit below I Spy, The Saint, Danger Man, and The Persuaders, MI nonetheless deserves a place at the table, especially the Bain/Landau episodes. Like all the great spy/thriller dramas from the 1960s, MI excelled with its storyline. The producers, writers, and directors knew the value of constantly advancing the story, a skill in short supply for current TV fare, as anyone who has watched 24 over the past few seasons can testify. Mix in an acting ensemble capable of top level performances, instead of cartoon caricatures, and you had, in MI, a rare and wonderful treat for TV.<br/><br/>Two other things, however, deserve mention. First, I personally found the first year with Steven Hill to be my favorite. While I liked the Peter Graves episodes, somehow, he will always be \"the new guy\" in my book. Maybe it's because the entire MI experience is impressed on my memory by context. Namely, I remember how during that first season, following the weekly visit my parents took to see my grandparents, my father would then race back across town just in time for us all to tune in. I seem to remember that was on Saturdays--early. We never had that experience with subsequent years, as, I believe, MI moved to late Sundays in 1967.<br/><br/>Second, there is the issue of the set design and costuming. Granted, this is only something I've become sensitive too since the initial run of the series back in the 1960s. But the studio shoots, the sometimes too artificial set designs, and the generic uniforms used for East bloc guards and soldiers cause the series to suffer a bit, especially in comparison to the exotic locations of the other great American spy drama from the Sixties, I Spy.<br/><br/>Finally, about Bain and Landau. There was a tremendous amount of buzz about this couple while the series aired. Barbara Bain, in particular, exemplified an allure that is timeless. What a disappointment, then, when, after leaving MI, they finally re-appeared together on TV in the dreadful Space: 1999. Both had faded as stars. But worse, both let their reputations suffer by placing themselves under the direction of one of the worst schlock profiteers in TV at the time, Gerry Anderson.

After nearly forty years, I can vividly remember sitting in my living room at 7:30 on a Saturday night in September of 1966, by chance watching the local CBS affiliate. I had no idea what to expect when I saw a disembodied hand, holding a match, light a fast-burning fuse. What followed was a collage of previews for the coming sixty-minute adventure. So superb was the plotting, dialog, and characterization, I was hooked for the next seven years! This series was such an intellectual exercise, it was like watching a fast-paced chess match, if you can imagine such a thing. Three of my favorite episodes come immediately to mind. \"The Mind Of Stefan Miklos\" was Peter Graves' personal favorite, and mine. It was the the true epitome of this series. To the uninitiated, it may have appeared confusing, but this was quality television. Unlike so many current television shows and movies, this episode, and the entire series, credited viewers with having a brain. If you were paying attention, you could actually follow the supremely intricate plotting. Next was \"The Glass Cage\" with guest villain Lloyd Bochner as the warden of a high-tech Iron Curtain prison. IMF scammed Bochner's character into releasing a high-profile prisoner after convincingly planting false evidence of mistaken identity. Finally, there was \"Doomsday\" with Alf Kjellin as the incumbent \"baddie\" auctioning off a stolen atomic weapon to the highest bidder. IMF cleverly rendered the weapon inert just as the Kjellin was being paid for his now-useless goods. I can name at least five other episodes that are, far and above, superior to the three big-screen versions recently released. Perhaps Paramount is listening. For the next big-screen venture, I suggest a retro-cold-war plot set in the 1950's or 1960's when IMF was first formed, tied to contemporary headlines like the Suez Crisis, Berlin Wall, or Cuban Missile Crisis complete with Peter Graves or Martin Landau look-alike actors.

This is Art at the Picasso level. Jason can do, in one 5-minute sequence, more to demonstrate emotion or frustration than those CSI clowns show in an entire series.

Everything about her is flabby &amp; unprivileged. How do you do a casting call for such a role? It is decidedly non-glamorous.

The love of creating something special, together, is palpable and a joy to watch. The production values and cinematography soar, on a level with any good motion picture.

Sometimes they merge, but not always, and come to think of it, not that often. This plot device keeps the viewer guessing _ and focused. What's most fascinating, however, is that the cases aren't always solved, the characters don't always survive and the endings aren't always happy. Or, sometimes, one case is solved and all is well while the other goes haywire. And sometimes there is a carryover of character or plot. You just never know.

As Shakespeare said \"There is nothing new under the sun\", and The Bridge isn't exactly new either. It's a remake of Denmark's \"Bron\", which also means \"the bridge\". Yet while the original focused on a crime that took place on the borders of Denmark and Sweden, FX's version focuses on the much grittier border of Mexico and the U.S., specifically the darkly criminal Juarez and comparatively backwoods El Paso. When a woman is found murdered and laid out directly on the border bridge, it forces law agents from both locations to work together.<br/><br/>This show is dense and rich, the TV equivalent of brownie cheesecake. It starts with the two leads, Diane Kruger playing Det. Sonya Cross and the real find- Demian Bichir as her Mexican counterpart Marco Ruiz. Kruger is playing down the physical beauty that landed her the roll of Helen in the movie Troy, and her Det. Cross is so socially awkward because of her struggle with Asperger's her scenes are painful to watch- in the good way. While there were times when I thought Kruger was overdoing it slightly, there was nothing jarring, and there were moments of fragility she played beautifully. Ruiz is her polar opposite, smooth and charismatic, charming ladies out of information as quickly and easily as Cross causes people to shut down. Bichir, whose IMDb credits are mostly Spanish language rolls, displays acting as effortless as his character's charm- there wasn't a single false note. Their assumptions of one another and the way their behavior is expected to be, should be, and will be compared to the actions they actually take is wonderfully constructed conflict that transcends the clich\u00e9 butting of heads usually found in plots like this.<br/><br/>There are other threads and characters presented that aren't immediately clear how they relate to each other, mainly a recently widowed politician's wife, played by the always-good-to-see Annabeth Gish, whose husband was into something behind literal closed doors. There's an egotistical reporter that is introduced as a stereotype who quickly develops pathos when put in a unique danger. We also glimpse a sinister coyote- not the animal, but someone who escorts illegal immigrants across the border for high prices- but his may be the highest of all. There were complexities of family and mentors added to the leads, and the writers balanced all of this without being convoluted or feeling like anything was just filler.<br/><br/>A lot happened though very little was revealed in the hour and half pilot, at no point did I find this languid. The Bridge is drawing comparisons to another Denmark import, AMC's The Killing- but after just the first episode I already have higher hopes for it- even though The Killing was another show I thoroughly enjoyed. There was more delicious tension here. There is also a healthy dose of trepidation while watching. We the viewers are preparing for (and looking forward to) dark times ahead. There is such a sense of place; I love when a location becomes something of a character in and of itself. There are hints of politics, national and race, which entered into the scope of the show without any screechy preaching. Even the cinematography is high quality and real- the night feels like night, not just day with a lens filter.

I'm a fan of Swedish thrillers but given the numerous comments to the effect that the plot as basically been true enough to the original, and given I've started to watch this American version I'll wait till I've seen the 13 episodes. With the last eight episode of the last season of 'Breaking Bad' around the corner, the timing for launching 'The Bridge' is fortuitous. <br/><br/>Having watched only the first three episodes so far, I'm satisfied that the IMDb storyline will suffice for the prospective viewer's 'need to know' about the plot. I was a huge 'Breaking Bad' fan and I sense that once viewers have seen at least a few episodes, they will want to see the rest, just like the Vince Gilligan series. The comparison is of course not based on the characters or the plot, as they are far apart from each other. What makes me use this comparison is that the characters are developing before our eyes in much the way as the award winning series did develop its characters.<br/><br/>Most of the negative reviews about the first few episodes have been focused on the performance of Diane Kruger; so here's my take on this to start off. She plays a detective with Asperger syndrome and that is a most difficult role to do, for anyone. That syndrome is a form of autism and viewers may tend to compare her performance to that of notables who have played so brilliantly such role before; I'm thinking of course of Dustin Hoffman and Claire Danes. But Asperger is just not the same. Some reviewers were kind enough to relate their personal experiences dealing with Asperger individuals and if you do your research you will find out the characteristics of these individuals afflicted with the syndrome are ones very hard to detect on the surface or in casual contact. Hence, Kruger's character will not be endearing; it would make no sense, unless the producers were going for flash. I'll admit I was put off by the character at first (1st episode) but once I got to understand the character, and after a little research, I love Kruger's performance.<br/><br/>The counterpart to Kruger's Sonya Cross character, is Marco Ruiz, played oh so well by Damian Bichir. The dynamics of these two main characters are so different in that each has much to be concerned about personally, Cross with the future of her job and Ruiz with the life of his family at risk; such is only scratching the possibilities and directions the investigation can and will be taking us. Each episode so far has had developments that ramp up the intrigue and get us more and more involved and wanting to know WHAT NEXT.

It is an anime set in a world where the people are wielding magic and are called (you guessed it) wizards. They form guilds which operate by taking on a wide range of requests from various clients and receiving the reward for each request. Now I'm going to give you my opinion focusing on negatives of this show, as I am pretty sure there are many reviews here that explain the positives better than I can. Generally speaking, it has some good elements, like character development and after the end of every arc, there are a few episodes where the protagonists are just being themselves, having fun which will give you a needed break from the intense action of the previous episodes. It also has some bad-ass moments, our main characters have mostlty distinct personalities from the others, but the show also has almost every shounen cliche in the books and unfortunately some serious flaws. One of those is the lack of long term consequence (e.g. death or an impairment of some sort) on the main roster. Seriously, I watched over 200 episodes of a show filled with fights and yet there are no actual consequences whatsoever! Also, almost always the wizards from the main guild never lose. God forbid something bad might happen and we actually worry. With 1 or 2 exceptions at most all the major villains are defeated by the main character, even though they are way more powerful and often there is someone stronger who is a match for them on the side of the good guys. Furthermore, most arcs (as far as I have watched) are essentially the same. There is some vague source of power that a villain (usually a guild of villains) tries to get to and it's up to our heroes to stop them, which by itself is not bad but it gets really boring when you see the same thing over and over again. Another thing that also sucks (at times) is the fights. When there is an attack about to land on an opponent, instead of actually showing the attack land, there is a cut to what happened just after the attack has landed with the attacked preferably in the air vocally expressing his/her pain. Now, granted does this happen every time? No, but it happens often enough that it becomes a problem. Not to mention most fights are very short, like 2-3 mins short but they cut to another scene mid-fight in to order to fool you and think that the fight was longer than it actually was. But unfortunately the flaws don't end here. It feels like every other episode there is an emotional scene which is forced as hell and there is way too much fan service, ranging from having some way to show a girls boobs (which gets annoying fast and happens all the god damn time) to characters being able to use powers that they shouldn't be able to, BREAKING THE VERY RULES THAT THE ANIME HAS ESTABLISHED FOR ITS WORLD.

One, the action is good and well detailed, the comedy is hilarious and used at the right times, and it's eye-opening discussions make you love the characters even more. Every time I watched an episode, I would have many different reactions to them. Sometimes I'll be, 'oh that was good', or 'what the hell did I just watch', or 'that was freaking intense!', or 'that was depressing' and... you get the point. My point is that this series will leave you with many different emotions as you walk away from it. Some may say it is over the top when it comes to the humor or the action, but still, it sticks to the story and it doesn't care if anything is over the top. Some people may not like this series for a multitude of reasons. The only problem I personally had with it, was how long the series goes. I am not a huge fan of long-running animes because of filler episodes, or it drags on sometimes, but that is just me. Another thing I'd like to point out, is this is an anime that is not meant to be watched seriously. At all. There are many serious moments when it comes to death, loneliness, or family, which I will point out makes the story even more interesting and will sometimes leave you with a new perspective on the little things around you. This anime series is meant to be watched solely for entertainment. The emotional parts and situations will definitely get to you when they come, but for the most part, this is an anime that is just fun to watch simply for the heck of it.

What can be said about the story? Nothing really special, a girl named  Lucy wants to become a wizard in a famous guild and after she meets  Natsu one of its members she manages to join him and thus they form a  team and start on taking missions and embark on journeys.The story  progresses in arcs with each arc being connected nicely with the next  one and the transition between them feels smooth and logical. The  atmosphere and the nature of each arc generally remain the same  lighthearted and cheerful vibe following the vibe of the anime on its  whole except for some moments and scenes which need to be dark to show  the contradiction between good and evil. Although the story of each  individual arc can be described as clich\u00e9 you could at least expect the  execution to be masterful for a popular anime like this, right? No they  decided to s**t all over the place with the word mediocrity, there are  some glimpses of good storytelling and directing in some arcs but this  is exactly what they are, glimpses.Individual elements of each arc are  interesting but the story itself is unoriginal although how it's told  and executed is what counts the most and this show had the potential to  be great but they vomited it all out to appeal to the general public  and/or their target group, if this was their purpose than they nailed  it. Linear,repetitive and predictable storytelling and the use of  generic guidelines as in any typical shounen of this type leave no room  for the element of surprise for some rare plot twists that might exist.  Generally the arcs are short and leave no room for good development and  the pace of each arc is out of place. I felt that some arcs needed  faster pace but others slower, go figure. Some episodes are uneventful  with no action and on top of that no story or character development of  any kind. Dialogues are mediocre and superficial for the most part but  there are comedic moments where combined with sound and animation made  me actually laugh hard. The blend of action, comedy and drama is  mediocre and as I already mentioned \"Oh the potential!!!!\".  Fairy Tail's characters is another disappointing fact. We are  introduced to a large cast of characters who are one dimensional and  static. Main characters are flat and underdeveloped. I understand that  combined with short arcs there isn't much room left to develop so many  of them but they could at least try. Every stereotype of this genre can  be found in this series, from the typical hotheaded male protagonist to  the evil villain who becomes good and changes sides and the fact that  most of them remain the same throughout the series makes this show even  more predictable. It's impossible to be caught by surprise when you  expect for them to act based on their generic stereotype and they act  exactly like that in any given situation. The villains of the show are  equally as underdeveloped as the main characters  The last disappointing fact I want to mention is the fighting scenes.  Battle system is your typical \"raw strength+power ups wins\" concept.  Almost no amount of thought or originality can be traced anywhere. Some  abilities are cool but that's it. The battles are won by overpowering  the enemy and no strategical thinking is involved. Superficial and  annoyingly tiring dialogs and monologues which ruin the pace of the  story take place in every fight scene and I mean literally in EVERY  fight scene. I know that concepts like friendship and comradeship are  important don't misunderstand me but not when they are in excess and  feel like they try to nail it in my brain with a drill and on top of  that at the expense of the story. Power levels are confusing.There are  no trainings but main characters manage to win enemies they shouldn't  be able to win like ever. Oh yea I forgot the power of friendship and  nakamas!!! Silly me.  Generally this whole thing can be summed up in 6 steps. Step 1: A  strong enemy appears. MC's are beaten up by the enemy. Step 2: MC's  yell about friendship and the power of nakamas. Step 3: They power up  emotionally and physically by the power of friendship and random stuff.  Step 4: MC's overpower the villain. Step 5: No training of any kind  whatsoever. Step 6: New arc. Go to step 1. When an anime can be summed  up like this than in my books this is not good at all.  Animation is top notch and very consistent, facial expressions are  distinct and well portrayed. As for the sound it's the most positive  thing of this show. It's quite brilliant and fits well to every scene  and arc of this show. Voice actors are for the most part all great.  All in all fairy tail generally has a vibe of positivity and  lightheartedness. If you like characters that seem cool, raw power,  mc's that overpower their enemies who rely on their friends and protect  each other, if you like good animation with awesome soundtracks mixed  perfectly to every scene, if you liked something like D-Gray Man or  Bleach than you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it  very much.I definitely recommend this to children as well. But if you  are an experienced anime viewer or if you like intelligence, good  story,plot and character development if you like insane plot twists and  strategic battle scenes with complex fighting systems or if you want to  watch something of this genre but don't have much time than don't waste  it on this and watch something like Hunter x Hunter or Fullmetal  Alchemist Brotherhood.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "37 out of 75 found this helpful.", "date": "26 January 2014"}, {"title": " Heavy fan service and repetitive plot", "content": "At first I was really excited for fairy, the first couple of episodes were alright, but then it just started going down hill.

But it's ohhhh so shiny!!!", "content": "I really don't know how best to write this...<br/><br/>I just binged on the first 48 episodes thanks to Netflix. <br/><br/>Fairy Tail is the story of a wizard guild set in a World a lot like ours. It begins with Lucy, a young user of celestial magic who wants to join the Fairy Tail guild. After meeting Natsu, she is inducted into the guild and meets (amongst others); Gray, Erza, Loke, Elfman, Mira, Cana. What follows is the relationships, surprises and histories of majority of these characters.<br/><br/>The show essentially, after the first few episodes of meeting everyone, follows the same patter; the team accept a mission, they meet some impossibly hard foe, the foe has henchmen, the minor characters defeat the henchmen and are rendered incapable, Natsu defeats the big bad (sometimes with help/ encouragement from others). In amongst the fighting, or just before/after, we'll be introduced to the next big bad, or it will be hinted at, and then we'll have a nice reprieve before it all begins again. <br/><br/>So, due to this, the character development can be a bit lousy - the only 'development' I remember is Elfman and his history with Lisanna which builds to the unleashing of Mira's true powers in the penultimate episode. We never see the characters training, they usually just get better when they need to. Lucy's celestial guardians seem kind of lame when we first meet them all (Taurus looses against a monkey) but then they just keep getting better because the enemies just keep getting (apparently) harder. Natsu always seems to fight like someone who's never been in a fight when he first encounters a bad guy but then, after being pummelled (and after a reminder of the true strength that lies within him from Erza or Gray or Makarov or Gajeel or Happy) rises up and, using the same technique that just had his butt handed to him, wins. <br/><br/>Then there's the illicit details of how the magic is working. I mean, really, I can't be bothered to here for the umpteenth time how that magic spell will obliterate everything in its path. I can figure out why Natsu is shooting flames out his feet to act like a jet and penetrate a forcefield, thank you very much... is this a Japanese thing? The need to be so heavy with exposition?<br/><br/>Add to that the very confusing dialogue (I watched with subtitles) which never seems grammatically correct and you're sometimes confused as to how Erza's armour just happens to be the right combination... and how did Gray just? Oh never mind.<br/><br/>Because this show is awesome.<br/><br/>Seriously.<br/><br/>The magic and action sequences are always a lot of fun and very high energy. Some of the magic abilities are really cool (one summons a demon that tears its way into our reality, that one was spooky). Even if they do talk so much. My favourite is probably Juvia (as in Lluvia, the Spanish for rain). She's an elemental, or so they say, and has complete control over water. She can create it, manipulate it, transform into it... some of my favourite fight scenes involve her, so it's always a shame when she gets knocked out or incapacitated before even getting started. The animation is some of the coolest I've ever seen. I love the character and the magic, not to mention the scenery and moods that the animators create.<br/><br/>Then there's the soundtrack, if only they put the same energy into the writing as they did the soundtrack! The score is just breathtaking. Hooks all over the place. Strings to make a grown man weep at just the right moment. It's very folksy and reminds me of the Game of Thrones theme tune. Perhaps the person who wrote for GoT got the inspiration from Fairy Tail?<br/><br/>The other awesome factor involves the characters. Although they're criminally underused at times, they are all different and all memorable. Each of them have strengths and weaknesses and quirks and, surprising for a serial cartoon (or any series for that matter), they're yet to become plot devices. They remain true to themselves throughout. The only issue I have is that, when one of them seemingly sacrifices themselves for the good of the guild (and it happens a lot), the awesome soundtrack kicks in and it seems like someone is about to bite the bullet. But then it turns out they were only knocked out... I mean, if you're gonna be knocked out, you probably don't need to make such a song and dance of it.<br/><br/>So, despite some bad writing flaws and a fair bit of unoriginal writing, Fairy Tail is still one of my favourite animes.

In this respect, it has a different importance. The series can be criticized in many ways, but it should be noted that it is the first Turkish-made Netflix series.<br/><br/>A beautiful story was written by combining Turkish history and places with fantastic elements. In the first part, we see that Istanbul was brought to the forefront. Towards the end of the chapter, the story is revealed. Fluent and immersive, have a different taste. We immediately understand that this is a Netflix series. Another thing I like in this series is; showing past. The story goes back to the Ottoman period.<br/><br/><a href=\"/name/nm4293138/\">\u00c7agatay Ulusoy</a> are really good. I can't say the same thing for women actors.

No need to tell <a href=\"/name/nm0476011/\">Mehmet Kurtulus</a> and <a href=\"/name/nm1204652/\">Okan Yalabik</a>. <a href=\"/name/nm6131602/\">Mehmet Yilmaz Ak</a> successfully playacts a small man trying to turn a big job. Although it is one of the remaining roles in the background, it is necessary to underline the player's success. I wish he had more roles.<br/><br/>Let's come to the bad sides of the series. The biggest problem of the series is dialogues. The dialogues were written so badly that even the best actor was unnatural. Continuously repeating the words of \"immortal\" and \"guard\". A little artificial. Cinematographer did a good job but vfx was bad. Special effects should have been better. The powers of the hero are not fully explained. These should be told to the audience. This beautiful story could have been better with a good script. After winning the superhero powers, there must be an improvement in his character but there is no such thing here. Still same. If you are making a superhero series, it must have plenty of action scenes. And these action scenes must be incredible cool. Unfortunately, there are very few action scenes. The series is nice compared to the standard Turk series, but it's a little bad for the Netflix series.<br/><br/>It should be noted that this series is a few steps away from the originals of Netflix in different countries. The lesser the budget allocated to the series may have an impact on this. Because with a higher budget, it would be possible to enjoy a completely different narrative that the journey to different times.<br/><br/>As a result; I'm positive about this series. For the first time, we encounter such a fiction. Of course, it has shortcomings, but it's never bad.

These two ingredients combine to make up an insidiously alluring cocktail, which may explain why B &amp; B, in spite of its cheesiness, has the potential for becoming addictive, as exemplified by so many testimonials, both within my own social circle and elsewhere (for example, on this website). The principal characters, who are rarely seen engaged in normal activities (such as work), are prone to proclaim their undying loyalty to one another, backed by strong moral principles, family values, marriage etc., then break their promises and behave like alley cats, just a few weeks down the track. One example amongst hundreds: when Brooke is confronted by Taylor with the question: 'How could you sleep with Nick the night you thought your husband had died?', she contrives to look dutifully repentant and says something like 'I don't know how to explain it'. Not very convincing. The endless proclamations of belief in the sanctity and permanence of marriage are contradicted with monotonous regularity by the behavior of most characters. In spite of this, all second, third etc. weddings take place in a chapel in the presence of an (ostensibly Christian) celebrant. Christianity of course, or at least the traditional view of it, is frequently set aside when characters indulge in bitching about one other, undermining the reputation of others, cheating in various ways, etc. The most common method of rumbling the frequent conspiracies is by eavesdropping behind a half-closed door, then charging into the conspiratorial environment and confronting the conspirators with dramatic remarks. Again, not very convincing. There seems to be a tendency, on the part of the scriptwriters, to demonize female characters to a greater extent than male ones. There are no male counterparts to Sheila, Stephanie or Sally Spectra, just to name a few. The glitzy ambiance and would-be glamorous surroundings are an obvious smokescreen, designed to hide the basically vacuous lives of the majority of characters, deprived as they are of any authentic ideals.

You Slept With My Brother !!\"", "content": "..And that's maybe not the worst yet!<br/><br/>Since the 1950s, soap operas, in radio and TV, had their lovers. However, (Dallas) came out in (1979) to make a great effect on the TV soap operas with its wicked formula of manipulating everybody and everything just for having you on your seat for years! Watch that effect on next soaps like (Knots Landing - 1979) or (Falcon Crest - 1981). But some goods, when outlive for more than their competence, transform into envenomed!<br/><br/>At first, (B &amp; B) was another, late 80s, so TV-ish, daytime soap. Namely hot, melodramatic and yeah.. boring! But after that, it turned - while keeping itself outwardly glossy - into ugly huge farce.<br/><br/>I can't say it's a diary of a family. I can't say it's fine thrilling melodrama. I just can say that it's a living exploitation of soap. And you know what? It's successful. So successful indeed!<br/><br/>(The Bold and the Beautiful), after 22 years and counting, is a real fine example of the kind of drama which some viewers need everyday like a requisite meal to satisfy their hanger; for living a romance, feeling rich, beating enemies.. etc. whatever the acting was, and whatever the manipulation is.<br/><br/>I somewhat caught on its formula: a sexual desire, a sinful love, a separation between 2 lovers, a wicked plot and a surprise. Then another round. Then another one. Then another with other characters, with new characters, then between the old and new characters, then between them and us maybe!, then the same formula again with the same characters afresh, going on and on, till the end of you, the end of days, or the end its time on screen (meaning: its cancellation!).<br/><br/>It's a perfect scheme. So loved and long-lived. But who can stand endless storylines, everlasting dialogue, the silence of the actors before cutting to another scene or commercials, and - most of all - the changing of partners?? Whoever can stand all of this, for more than 5500 episodes, I'm surely not one of them. Why is that? Because I don't have non-critic mentality, a desperate passion for melodrama, and that PATIENCE!<br/><br/>Speaking about the changing of partners thing, I recall a line was said by (Dean Stockwell) in one of (Quantum Leap)'s episodes talking about a soap opera: \"Here Sam, everybody is sleeping with everybody!\". (B &amp; B) maybe broke this rule since in it everybody slept, sleeps, and will sleep with everybody! Sometimes I think that they have nothing to do in this world but sleeping with each other, then chatter and chatter and chatter, to re-sleep again yet with others. It's not the story of life, it's the life of very profitable story! I know that it got the power to make you sleep in front of it too!<br/><br/>Did its success become a curse?! I don't completely think so. Not for the actors, since they're all well-paid. Not for the viewers, since they get what they want. But maybe for the writers. These people got to write one work for over than 2 decades?? OH MY GOD! This is, in spite of all the money in the world, so heavy mission to be done. So, based on my compassion, I'll forgive them for such events like the one of my title's line which was the first thing I heard when I tried to continue watching this series again, after years of losing any interest in it (Yes, first I felt panic, thinking that the mom slept with her own son, but I understood it right later!). However, when things reach this far, I invite you to do what I already did: Change the Channel. Believe me, you'll feel so bold and beautiful after!<br/><br/>In the next episodes I bet you; the son will turn out to the real father of his sister, (Ridge) will turn out to be a brother of his mother, (Eric Forrester) will have a sex change operation, (Brooke) will turn into lesbian (if she didn't yet?!), and I can see the end right now; the aliens will take them all away (it kind of happened before, didn't it?!); and for that alone I'll salute the creative writers. Simply, what can a teleplay writer do.. More?!!!<br/><br/>Originally, as much the viewers want it, as much it gains more time on air, and so.. that's what has to happen. Though it triumphed over any jesting - even its own - already, being the most-watched soap in the world, with an audience of an estimated 26.2 million viewers in more than 110 nations. So while I believe that it is provoking sitcom; running without laughing tracks or laughing, others don't, and that's in fact what makes it provoking. But everybody got their own classics.

But now, after watching it on Amazon's stream service, I realized how wrong I was.<br/><br/>As a huge fan of Alias that I am, of course that comparisons are inevitable thru the episodes, but there's no room here for that glossy spy fetish sci-fi that somehow corrupted J.J. Abrams's show thru the seasons. Covert Affairs instead tries to be more down to earth like Veronica Mars.<br/><br/>As an episode themed series that it is, we cannot expect much plot development more than some action sequences that follows the main character's \"weekly missions\" and some lazy twists and cliched conflicts of the genre here and there. But anyway, the show makes its point as a light entertainment for those who just want to sit and watch it without the need to think too much. It has its charms though, like the main cast. Piper does a great job as the CIA recruit Annie Walker, and Keri Matchett as her CIA commander Joan Campbell is definitely an empowering role. Supporting actors like Christopher Gorham and Sendil Ramamurthy grows a lot throughout the seasons, and the chemistry between all of them is what makes viewers give it a fair try.<br/><br/>The best of the show is that Annie Walker is really well developed at the moment viewers realize that she gets stronger as her experience grows thru episodes and missions complexities expands. She gets smarter, more tactical and mature in a natural pace. That's why first 2 seasons looks a little clumsy and generic, like a derivative product of those aforementioned shows and then it gets better and some kind solid after that, finding its own personality from that on.<br/><br/>Interesting how a simple show as it is can turn out to be satisfactory and never pretentious. And five seasons were the necessary to make it not remarkable, but enjoyable in the exact amount.<br/><br/>Give it a try, you'll enjoy it as much as I did.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "16 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "2 November 2018"}, {"title": " Wow", "content": "When I saw who the producers are, I must admit, I felt some trepidation.

I'm not an easy judge to please, but I must say, I'm hooked.<br/><br/>The characterization was fabulous. The writers laid the strong foundation of the friendship/confidant relationship that few shows have managed to convey, and it's just the pilot. I can't wait to see how it's built up. The last time I saw such a thing, it was in BONES, and that was in the middle of the first season. <br/><br/>Piper Perabo plays a smart, overachieving spy missing the stop-digging-yourself-into-a- hole complex. Her character is balanced by a great performance by Christopher Gorham as Auggie, your friendly neighborhood blind tech-guy, a comforting voice in the madness of the \"Agency\". To top off the show, you have their boss, a preoccupied career woman used to having to find her own way in a job traditionally held by men: Joan Campbell, played by Kari Matchett. <br/><br/>For those of you thinking it's just another ALIAS, you've got another thing coming, just as I did. The only things it's got in common with J. J. Abrams' hit show is the CIA and strong woman lead. It has the action of all the best action films of the decade and the reasonably- subtle humor of BURN NOTICE and CHUCK. <br/><br/>COVERT AFFAIRS is in it for the long-run.

Half way through season 5 I'm updating this review and my rating as season 4 took to a level few shows achieve with me. I like how they've taken us with a novice CIA agent at the beginning who gets progressively better with each season with her starting as a talented rookie she quickly raises her stock to a driven professional who has gone dark and from not carrying a gun to plugging the bad guys with regularity, and satisfaction (mine). The depth and intensity of the story grows right along with the character such that by the beginning of Season 4 each show is leaving me at the point where I can't stop and need to see the next episode to get more answers. Since I am streaming the show this only presents the problem of burning through the episodes to fast and being left without a favorite show to watch sooner than I would like. <br/><br/>Bottom line is if you like an spy based action adventure then give the show a chance and I think you'll enjoy the ride. It has flaws, but the purpose is to entertain and engage and with each additional episode it does just that at an increasing level. Unfortunately season 5 lost its way and the apex of the show turned out to be the season finale for season 4. At that point there was a wonderful plot just laying there for Annie to return to Augie and move upward and onward. Instead they changed the formula and destroyed the show. What more evidence is needed than barely caring to watch the end of season 5 and having it cancelled shortly thereafter. Sad to see so much potential wasted, would be happier to have had it shut down after the end of season 4 and lived with what could have been than to see what they did to it. Still love it. Look at SOA, 6 masterpiece seasons with a final season that I couldn't hardly watch. Still think it is a great show, but final season killed it. Well in this case the writers in season 5 truly did kill it as it is officially cancelled which is what actually got me to watch the last 3 episodes.

However, at the beginning of 2002, I began to watch the series on a regular basis, right from it's first season and found to my surprise, what a funny, insightful and entertaining sitcom it was.<br/><br/>Mary Tyler Moore deserves kudos for her portrayal of Mary Richards, a ground-breaking character who was allowed to be her own person (a rare thing for female characters on television in those days). An intelligent, independent young woman in her 30's, whose wasn't \"hung up\" on not being married, and enjoyed her life and her career. The rest of the cast also deserve mention for their memorable performances. Ed Asner as the gruff, yet lovable Lou Grant (Mary's boss at WJM-TV), Valerie Harper as the sharp and sassy Rhoda Morgenstern (Mary's best friend and next door neighbour), Gavin Macloud as the witty &amp; thoughtful Murray Slaughter (Mary's fellow work mate at WJM), the late Ted Knight as the self absorbed and talentless Ted Baxter (who \"anchored\" the news in more ways than one at WJM-TV) and Cloris Leachman as the flighty and somewhat over-opininated Phyllis Lindstorm (Mary's other next door neighbour and friend).<br/><br/>The show was fortunate enough to benefit from first rate scripts from talented writers such as Jim Brooks &amp; Allan Burns (both of whom created the series), Treva Silverman, David Lloyd, Bob Ellison and Ed Weinberger.<br/><br/>Along with solid direction from vetran TV sitcom director Jay Sandrich (of \"I Love Lucy\" fame), it comes as no surprise that the series was both a critical and commerical success during it's seven year run on US television from 1970 to 1977. The show also benefited from later additions to the cast such as Georgia Engel as the sweet natured, yet rather naive Georgette Franklin (who was introduced into the series as a love interest for the idiotic Ted Baxter) and Betty White as the conniving &amp; man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens (host of \"The Happy Homemaker\" show at WJM-TV). On screen, she is the image of domestic knowledge and bliss, but once the camera's have stopped rolling, she is a woman on the prowl, striking at any man within distance (single or otherwise) who grabs her fancy!!. Earning a whole swag of Emmy Awards, the show was highly praised and rewarded for it's stellar efforts. I recommended those who are unfamiliar with the show to watch the series from the beginning, to appreciate and understand the nature of what it's all about. The humour is natural and witty (unlike many other sitcoms where the laughs are either forced or over-the-top).

I've really come to envy women who had real feminist heroes, real or fictional, such as Gloria Steinem, Bea Arthur as \"Maude\", and, of course, Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Richards. \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" isn't just an excellent sitcom with perfectly realized characters, but it featured an imperfect but winning heroine that any woman could look up to. Mary was a sweet-natured thirty-something who alternated between being high-strung and confident. She happily lived alone and had a loyal gal pal in smart mouthed New Yorker Rhoda (the incomparable Valerie Harper). Mary also was an associate TV producer at the low-rated WJM news network, where she had the respect of her male co-workers, including her arch-conservative boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner), wisecracking but tender-hearted work buddy Murray Slaugher (Gavin McLeod), and buffoonish anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight). Not that everyone loved Mary... she constantly had to deal with her insufferable, overbearingly perky landlady Phyllis (Cloris Leachman). When Phyllis was written out of the show, WJM's \"Happy Homemaker\" Sue Ann Nivens (flawless Betty White) replaced her as Mary's foil. Passive-aggressive and sex-starved, Sue Ann was a hilarious combination of Blanche from \"The Golden Girls\" and Harriet Nelson. Best of all, the show had running gags that somehow never went stale: Mary's tendency to attract the wrong men, her disastrous dinner parties, Ted's slips of the tongue on the air, Lou's annoyance at being the lowest-rated TV network, and Rhoda's quest for the perfect husband.

I love all the characters of the MTM show...they all had great lines, and those actors knew how to deliver. Mary Tyler Moore exemplified true sportsmanship in making this whole show a wonderful example of COMPLETE ensemble acting. Every character had his/her shining moments, time and time again. I was about nine when this show debuted, and truly grew up with it. I used to hate Ted, because he was so unbelievably stupid. However, now that I've spent twenty or so years in the work world, I have had the complete displeasure of working with Ted Baxters everywhere....so many who rise to their level of complete incompetence. And over the years, in watching reruns, I have come to fully appreciate Ted Knight's genius in his portrayal of Ted Baxter. The episode in which Mary is simply feeling completely down in the dumps...her motivation is gone for no apparent reason, other than the fact that she has hit a slump (a \"new apartment\" episode). Ted Knight's portrayal of Ted Baxter imitating her in her slumpy condition, and repeating the whole scene with identical dialog but with a completely different attitude, basically showing Mary that she has to appreciate what she has in life, and look at it all with a different, positive perspective, was sheer comedic genius at its finest.<br/><br/>The final episode of this series portrayed my comment about Corporate America very realistically, and the episode itself is one for a time capsule....just bottle it up. Ditto for the \"Chuckles the Clown\" episode...and for the \"Veal Prince Orloff\" episode. Actually, I'd love to put all of MTM's episodes, along with those from the Dick Van Dyke Show, in a time capsule and send them into space. Nick at Nite should run episodes only from MTM, the Dick Van Dyke Show, Bob Newhart, and The Wonder Years. That is all that that station needs, and I'm sure that the ratings would go through the roof. But back to Mary....her show was a brilliant gem that graced the world of American television, and no other show will ever hold a candle to it....EVER. Yes, Seinfeld was funny, and \"breakthrough\", in being a show about nothing, and it even offered phrases that entered our vernacular. But it missed the one key element that MTM had in spades...heart. The Seinfeld show, as funny as it always was, really never made you cry or pulled at your heart strings...ever (other than maybe making you cry from laughter). The MTM Show, on the other hand, combined humor, drama, reality, the absurd, the sublime, and a lot of warmth all rolled into one magnificent, shining, seven-year love-fest for our pop culture, and I thank Mary for giving us this bright light. In a comic strip that was published I believe just the Sunday after the last episode aired, a man was depicted throwing his television set out his window, crying. The cartoonist captured the national sentiment quite beautifully. I miss Mary and her gang to this day.

Despite MTM as it's star and some very talented supporting characters, CBS did not like the idea of a young woman who was single-by-choice as a lead character. The show was given a poor time slot, and early reviews from test audiences and critics were less than favorable. So one may say it's odd how 7 years later (when the show aired it's final episode in March 1977,) it was one of the most awarded and critically acclaimed show not only of the 1970s, but of all time.<br/><br/>The first season is a shaky one for many (it happens to be my favorite.) Mary Richards, a 31 year old single woman working as associate producer for the fourth rate WJM news, is finding her footing in Minneapolis. What she lacks in confidence she makes up for in beauty --- never has MTM or the character of Mary Richards looked more beautiful with her long raven hair, mini skirts and dresses, and knee high boots. Many of the early episodes focus entirely on Mary, and while the scenes at her home were flourishing, the scenes featuring her at work were... well, a bit boring. This season can also be noted for showing Mary and the gang in the most settings (restaurants, dental offices, extracurricular clubs, outdoor shopping malls, house parties etc.) <br/><br/>By the second season, the writing had improved, although the first season *can* boast more memorable episodes. Nevertheless, the show strikes a finer balance between Mary at home with the wisecracking, pudgy Rhoda and the cultured, but snooty Phyllis, and her life at work with sarcastic Murray, dimwitted Ted, and the tough but lovable Lou. Was the second season better? From a critical point yes. But it's fresh appeal didn't match that of the first season.<br/><br/>It was the from the third season onward that things really were on a roll. The show was now a bona fide success (coming in at #10 in the Nielsen ratings for season 2,) thus giving the actors and writers a little leeway with the studio in terms of creative control. We see traces of \"All in the Family\" in this season as several TMTMS episodes deal with controversial issues like equal pay for woman, homosexuality, divorce and infidelity, birth control and premarital sex. But unlike \"All in the Family,\" these episodes and points were deftly written and sensitively acted... it was a rare treat to see a point made without pushing it down the throats of viewers.<br/><br/>The fourth season was about the same as the third, although things got a bit steamier in the office with the addition of Sue Ann Nivens, the dimpled but slutty host of WJM's \"The Happy Homemaker.\" Another character had been added as well - the soft-spoken but surprisingly intelligent Georgette, who becomes Ted's love interest. This was also the last season to feature Rhoda as a main character before she left to star in her own sitcom. <br/><br/>The fifth and sixth and seventh season were a change from the first four. With Rhoda gone, the writers had no choice but develop Mary into a more street smart, confident character. Her evolution can be seen throughout the first four seasons, but without Rhoda she had no best friend to ask advice from or talk about her dates with. She was now completely on her own and responsible for her own decisions. In the fifth season, she's promoted to the role of PRODUCER of the WJM news, a position few women held in the real world at the time. Another major development was the move she makes from her warm, stylish bachelor suite into a modern mid-1970s one bedroom high-rise. While her new home wasn't as 'cozy' or 'cute' as the first, it represented the financial and social gains she had made over the past six years.<br/><br/>The series would end in early 1977, just as television was pulling away from smart, adult- oriented comedy to a raunchier, sillier, more direct sense of comedy. The show essentially could have aired for another year, but the producers and MTM herself decided to go out while still on top. It's one of the few shows to air for such a long period of time and never experience any real decline in quality - a testament to the craft and talent of everyone involved in the show.<br/><br/>But TMTMS was more than just excellent comedy. It was a glowing testament that proved that a woman (or a man) could be in their 30s, could be single, and still live a productive and successful life. Somehow it disproved the fact that you were weird if you weren't married and didn't have a kid by the time you were 30. Whether MTM knows it or not, there's a whole generation of men and women who decided to go out and find themselves, get a career, and develop themselves as a human before rushing into a marriage and having kids. Taste is personal, but I feel safe in saying that no show has since done so much for it's viewers than TMTMS did. Some may be funny, some may be groundbreaking. But no show has ever made it's viewer feel less alone and more confident in themselves as working professionals and human beings than TMTMS did.

Well,from 1970 to 1977 I was only age 2 to 9,so it was beyond me then (I did see the opening credits but that's all.) In 1980/1981,the show was rerun here in Phoenix &amp; I saw only the pilot show,and about 4 others. The film then was scratchy with lines and age &amp; the sound was terrible. It was then gone from local TV here for 20 years &amp; I had no cable.<br/><br/>Fast forward to Aug. 2001,and I caught 5 shows on TV Land (at 6am!) on my apt. complex's clubhouse TV. Got to see Ted &amp; Georgette get married,Lou's apt. get decorated badly by Rhoda,Murray shove Sue Ann into a big cake and Chuckles bite the dust and the finale.<br/><br/>Now,2011. Ten years later,thanks to ME-TV having the show on 5 nights a week (formerly 7),I'm finally getting to really appreciate what a fine work of sitcom art this show was and still is. Some humor might be a touch dated but it's still funny and in terms of Ted Baxter,just downright hilarious.<br/><br/>Mary Tyler Moore made the seamless transition from wife Laura Petrie to independent professional woman Mary Richards. (4 years between helped also.) Mary is not just this but also holds very natural human qualities and frailties as well. This makes her character 100% likable and relatable. Not just to women but anyone. I love her in the early 1970 Christmas show where she has to work alone at the station on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>Rhoda is the perfect counterpart &amp; friend to Mary. The two compliment each other greatly on screen. Behind the scenes and on the show,the chemistry of friendship is very real. Seems too bad in a way that they took her to her own show but people watched that too.<br/><br/>Murray is delightfully sarcastic to Ted and a great friend to Mary and Lou. Lou Grant is the epitome of the boss but with a heart (despite trying to hide it). From Show #1,Ed Asner made it apparent what his character is all about.<br/><br/>Ted Baxter (the brilliant,late Ted Knight)is a pompous,egotistical,self loving egomaniac with the maturity of a high school boy . He's also a blundering buffoon on the air. As only Ted Knight could have played it. Why Georgette loves him is mystery but as she said,\"Someone has to\" .<br/><br/>Georgia Engel is fantastic here too. I always did like that unique voice of hers. <br/><br/>You gotta love &amp; hate Betty White as Sue Ann Nivens \"The Happy Homemaker\". Always pretty much on the make for Lou and always acting like a perfect 1950s TV housewife who escaped from a TV,only to land in 1974.<br/><br/>Part time character Phyllis (also got her own series) is one half snob and second half know it all. Before Sue Ann,she also had a tendency to needle Mary about her single status and sense of style.<br/><br/>Even though I've now only seen about 50 of these shows,I can honestly see why it won so many Emmys in the 1970s. Every actor is true to their character and every character has the \"real\" or \"human\" side to them,that makes them likable. Yes....even Ted Baxter.<br/><br/>Anyone who feels this is \"not\" a classic,does not know all that goes into making a sitcom. Not just making it funny but making it believable to the audience (and the critics). The actors have to believe themselves as these people as well and for what little I've seen,it's all A+ acting,writing and producing &amp; great comic timing.<br/><br/>It may have started 41 years ago and ended in 1977 but quality (in any form of entertainment) never goes out of style. 10 stars for the whole cast and crew,bravo....and Meow.

I didn't watch much television and the idea of a sitcom about a single woman had no interest to me. Then, after it was cancelled, a local TV station started showing two shows a night, back to back, and I started watching. At first I wasn't impressed. The early 70s fashions and hairstyles were horrific, the acting uneven, the topics dated and Moore occasionally overacted. But, as the series progressed, the writing got better, the cast got more comfortable with their roles and Moore toned it down a little. I still don't like the first season too much. It does introduce us to all the characters but it just seemed kind of forced. Also it was somewhat sexist. At one point Moore actually does Lou Grants' laundry! OK OK--his wife had left him but still... After the first season though the series picked up speed and just got better and better. It also showed a single woman living alone and liking it--a rarity for TV on those days. It even hinted that she had an off screen sex life. It also found humor in some taboo subjects. When Chuckles the Clown is inadvertently killed in one episode they actually made his death seem funny! Supposedly (according to Moores' autobiography)no one wanted to do it and some crew people were \"sick\" the week it was filmed. That episode went on the win a few Emmys and is considered a true classic. Also Moores' character got more liberated--especially during the last season. She got a steady boyfriend (Ted Bessell) and, at one point, gives him a long passionate kiss right in front of Lou Grant, Ted Baxter and Murray Slaughter. It all ends perfectly in the last episode.

Mary Tyler Moore is absolutely brilliant in her portrayal of the vulnerable and incredibly endearing Mary Richards, who embarks upon a career as an associate news producer in a small Minneapolis TV newsroom. Of course she was so compelling that it became difficult for her to shake the part and embark upon other roles. To most viewers, Ordinary People and other ventures notwithstanding, Mary Tyler Moore will always be Mary Richards.<br/><br/>Mary's relationships with the other employees in the newsroom and also her apartment neighbours make the series. The assorted newsroom characters include her gruff &amp; cynical but lovable boss, Lou Grant, the friendly &amp; witty news writer, Murray Slaughter (with whom Mary enjoys a genuine camaraderie), and the absurdly vain &amp; egotistical news anchor Ted Baxter, who cannot pronounce anything properly and invariably makes a complete fool of himself both on TV and off. The banter between Mary and her boss, Mr. Grant, is especially hilarious and the mutual respect &amp; affection touching. <br/><br/>Ed Asner masterfully portrays the news room boss, Lou Grant, with Gavin MacLeod playing the likable Murray Slaughter and Ted Knight the idiotic Ted Baxter. Later regulars include Georgette, Ted's friendly but naive blonde wife, and Sue Anne Nivens (Betty White), the annoying, man hunting domestic diva and star of the TV station's cooking program.<br/><br/>Mary longs for romance but meanwhile has close, dependable friendships not just at her job but also at home. She has an adorable bachelor apartment with a sunken living room. Upstairs in the attic apartment of this Victorian style house is the colourful, wise cracking Rhoda Morgenstern, played to perfection by Valerie Harper. The dialogue between the two is always priceless. Daring but cynical, Rhoda is the exact polar opposite to the more timid but always cheerfully optimistic Mary. Downstairs is the overbearing, irritating Phylis Lindstrom, played by Cloris Leachman. <br/><br/>Mary was something of a role model for the independent single career woman of that era. She had her trials and insecurities but invariably managed to cope on her own. Not only that, but she's always such a genuine lady. This series with its focus on friendship as opposed to romance is infinitely superior to the programming of today where the plot lines of the young career women tend to revolve around sex, often with a different man practically every night.

It's hard to believe very-very early episodes of \"MTM\" about Mary and Rhoda joining a divorce club and its strained humor was actually looser and freer and more amusing than what other sitcoms of the day had to offer. But it's true.<br/><br/>Although the first year of the show may be only sporadically humorous, it makes up for it in that \"MTM\" did one of the best jobs of capturing that weird melancholy of the era --- that mood that kind of defined the '70s, and was even more intense at the very start of the decade: this sort of lost, disillusioned, bittersweet, post-60s flavor which made everybody immediately seem as if they had a \"past\" from the moment they appeared on screen...<br/><br/>For anybody looking to see what it actually felt like living in the world at that particular moment in time -- at the cusp of the '60s and '70s -- it's captured vividly by such period montage sequences as the urban street scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY (1969) or the snow angels/ice skating sequence in LOVE STORY (1970) or the \"MTM\" show opening theme design from Season 1, even Mary and little Bess going shopping in a Minneapolis mall, etc...<br/><br/>The world actually felt that way at the time. It's not just a Hollywood construct.<br/><br/>To me, Season 1 of \"MTM\" is kind of a portal to 1970. I regarded it as such even as early as the late-70s (when the show was first in syndication) and it still hits me the same way whenever I see very early installments--- the look of the show and the forlorn music score... No, the comedy isn't quite as hilarious by the slick standards of sitcoms from more recent decades (or even compared to later episodes of the same show) but I still find the mood almost heart-breakingly captivating. It is so evocative of the era.<br/><br/>As the seasons rolled on, the comedy got sharper (by the standards of the day) even though that '70s somberness was gradually mitigated as it lessened in real life.<br/><br/>So it's a time capsule of sorts... One would think every show and movie filmed in a particular era would be, but that just isn't true. Clothes and cars from a period don't sell or convey the past to the present --- something has to be good, or at least right-minded, in order for the zeitgeist of the era in question to stick to celluloid. And \"MTM\" was one of those shows that did so.<br/><br/>It was also one of the rare series then to proceed in \"real time\" which gave the show a life, an energy, that most didn't have, even though it didn't delve into the then-shocking, in-your-face politics that ALL IN THE FAMILY soon would.<br/><br/>Folks who weren't around then probably aren't able to grasp how fresh this \"MTM\" show seemed back in 1970, given where TV was at the time. Or understand why all the terribly broad (some might even say groan-inducing) comedy directed at, and derived from, Ted Baxter during Season 1 -- which predominantly focused on his dumbness and inability to pronounce basic words -- could possibly ever have been once seen as \"funny\".<br/><br/>In fact, it was, however briefly, fall-off-the-couch funny. TV in the 1960s had fervently ignored the social changes of that decade (including the questioning of establishment authority) so seeing a revered image like the silver-haired newsreader held up as a buffoon was actually considered edgy, even though that context doesn't really \"read\" today. (That's not revisionism, I swear. And at least the writers realized they would soon have to write to Ted's narcissism and density in a more layered, sophisticated fashion, and they quickly did so.)<br/><br/>That says more about where the media culture was circa 1969 or 1970 than it does THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.<br/><br/>For all of the above reasons, Mary Richards became metaphorical for the early-to-mid 1970s, almost by accident: TV changed more between 1970 and 1975 than any other five year period in its history, in terms of content, and the television sitcom genre had literally become an agent for social change. And Mary Richards likewise grew during the seven years of the series from the quivery, vulnerable, lanky girl with the long, raven hair who let herself be gently bullied into giving up her family holiday visit at Christmas to cover for her co-workers in that 1970 episode (so wistfully forlorn for reasons hard to explain, except that it, too, captures the poignant atmosphere of the time precisely) into the almost cocky, seasoned professional who didn't pause to deliver a zinger to Ted or SueAnn when circumstances demanded it, and could grab and kiss her latest boyfriend in a public restaurant and then fluff her hair tauntingly at her voyeuristic co-workers as she sauntered out the front door.<br/><br/>Mary had grown up with us, or at least with the television medium, during it's most significant period of progression.<br/><br/>And then there's the actress herself, Mary Tyler Moore, whose own personal melancholia seemed to parallel that of the earlier part of that decade. Even with the same writers and co-stars, the show would never have felt the same without Moore and her intrinsic sense of haunted, detached nostalgia wrapped in winter's chill.", "rating": null, "helpful": "2 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "21 June 2013"}, {"title": " Background sound tracks", "content": "We thoroughly enjoyed the video release of the \"Complete First Season\" and hope there will be more.

The first two episodes, I was bored. But it was only the first two episodes, so I pushed through, and before I knew it, I was sucked. in. This show made me cry a significant amount, made me smile, and made me laugh a whole lot. The beginning and middle was amazing, but what was even better was the /ending/.<br/><br/>I haven't seen an ending that good--that satisfying--in a very long time. I was afraid at first, because when you watch as much stuff as I do, you get let down a LOT. But this ending was amazing. Nearly everything was resolved in a happy way. The characters were happy, not just in the how the writers thought they'd find happiness, but how the fans thought they'd find it. The last season was scary. Really had me on the edge of my seat. Which is a good thing. But it ended happy, which is also a good thing. A near perfect balance of drama and lighthearted fun and happiness.<br/><br/>And, one of the most important things: The representation. Nothing I've seen (that wasn't purely focus on the struggles of minorities) has represented the LGBTQ+ community that well. I'm a queer kid, so it was amazing to see. I was happy enough with Spinnerella and Netossa AND Bow's dads, but then THE main character being gay? That's such a rare thing, especially in kids TV. Seeing two girls, the main girls, kiss, not doing anything dirty, just kissing and holding onto each other, is so nice. I'm so glad young kids get to see that. I honestly didn't think it would happen, but it did and I'm so grateful.<br/><br/>Also, the new character designs are amazing. The old She-Ra, like pretty much every other show at the time, had overly-sexualized characters with impossible body types, teaching little girls that's what they should look like. Nobody healthy is that skinny. But the new She-Ra has thick characters! Short characters! Many different body types, and not in a shaming way whatsoever. And I'm white, so I absolutely can't speak for PoC, but I was happy to see so many PoC characters.<br/><br/>This show is amazing. It really brought out the little kid in me. Made me happy.

I loved the subtle and not so subtle references to other SciFi/Fantasy classics, and even some film noir. Kids will not know where that stuff came from, but it adds a lot for older viewers. The original Star Trek attempted to address controversial issues episode by episode, but She-Ra creates a real world as a single long story with continuity across the five seasons that maybe does an even better job of showing how we can achieve a better society thorough love and tolerance.

My younger brother really enjoyed He-Man and we used to love to play together as He-Man and She-Ra who were also brother and sister!<br/><br/>Now as an adult, I collected all of the dvds for He-Man and She-Ra which are hilarious to watch now with the shameful one-dimensional characters and gender stereotypes. The obligatory mascot/jesters (Kowl and Orco) and the strange moustached macho men (Bow and Master at Arms). It's especially funny to watch the episodes where He-Man visits Etheria - and his sister for random adventures - just stepping through a portal at will. Etheria seems to have a 95% female population and He-Man is in peril of sexual assault from all of She-Ra's flirty friends - all with names ending in A, and wearing as little as possible!!<br/><br/>Anyway, when I saw this new show advertised, I was worried about this being another lame reboot. It looked a lot like the style of Teen Titans and I was convinced this would be ruined for me. I couldn't be more wrong!<br/><br/>This is such a funny, engaging and refreshing reboot - I've been absolutely blown away by the level of detail and the obvious affection for the original show. It is very tongue in cheek but the depth of the characters really makes you care about the new personas. It changes the conception of 'good and evil' and how most people in a military force believe they are on the side of good, Look at all of the staff involved in working for the bad guys in James Bond films or even the Storm Troopers in Star Wars. Loyalty is usually to those closest to you, and the new Scorpia really shows this the best.<br/><br/>I love the fact that this strays from typical gender stereotypes and it even explains the love heart that Bow wears on his top! The episode where you see him at home is hilarious - even more so if you remember what the original Bow looked like!<br/><br/>For animation, it is fantastic to have female forms drawn in non-sexual ways. All of the Princesses look so different, and female, but not like they belong in a Victoria's Secret advert! The Japanese animation style really brings emotion to them and even more so in Season 3.<br/><br/>My younger self was always very annoyed at how weak and lame Adora was as her own character. She would always trip over tree roots and sounded so pathetic when she talked in a soft voice. In this show, Adora is a strong young woman in her own right, and it makes you feel she is much more deserving of the She Ra mantle. The way that she interacts with Catra throughout these 3 seasons really develops and makes you care about whether she can reach Catra in the end.<br/><br/>There is so much I could talk about with this new show, and while I rarely write reviews, this inspired me so much that I felt I had to share it. I cannot praise the writers and producers of this enough, and I honestly didn't believe that anyone could make a better show than the original. I am 40 years of age and She Ra made such an impact on my childhood. Now after seeing the new show, I absolutely love how anyone of any age can watch this and still take something away. This gives positive role models, with realistic body figures and questions morality at an individual level - rather than someone being just good or evil.

Having recently purchased the DVD set of the first season, I've been giving the show a lot of thought... Like many other TV shows both past and present, Dynasty started without a clear focus and eventually matured into something unique and far removed from what the producers originally intended. The show had two distinct eras: pre-Alexis and post-Alexis. No, Joan Collins didn't make or break Dynasty, but she gave it a heck of a fun \"flavor.\" At its inception, Dynasty was a serious, almost somber account of the lives of the super rich Carringtons of Denver, CO. There was patriarch Blake, confused son Steven, spoiled brat Fallon, and Blake's new and very overwhelmed wife, Krystle. Having now watched a little of that first season, I find myself eagerly waiting for Alexis to turn the family on its collective ear! Dynasty's ultimate strength, and also its downfall, was in its becoming campy and larger than life. While some of us may expect the super-wealthy to act crazy, Dynasty added plot lines and characters that were the traditional soap-opera themes magnified with a huge budget, and beautiful people... illicit affairs, long-lost children, traumatic pregnancies, murders, trials, etc... There were frequent mis-steps (the Moldavian Prince, Michael, comes to mind as well as the entire 'The Colbys' series) and there were truly fun characters like Alexis and son Adam whom we loved to hate.

Originally conceived to take on the CBS juggernaut Dallas, the show originally focused on the ultra-rich Carringtons, the middle-class Blaisdels, and the link between them, secretary-turned-socialite Krystle. After half a season, however (it was a mid-season replacement), the creative team decided to take the show in a different direction. They also brought in Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington. Originally intended only to appear in a few episodes, Alexis became such a hit with the viewers that the character quickly became central to the action.<br/><br/>The show, early in its run, was at its best when it nodded to classic Hollywood. The Steven-Claudia storyline, for example, was Dynasty's riff on the film Tea and Sympathy, and the sheer opulence of the show (and some of Claudia's crazier moments) were straight out of Sunset Boulevard. The writing was sharp, incisive, and not afraid to be funny. A brief implosion late in the second season got rid of half the cast, but one role (Steven) was recast, and another (Sammy Jo) would return sporadically for a couple of seasons before finally returning full-time. By the time the show had four seasons under its belt, it was a solid top ten hit that actually showed a lot of quality as the writers tackled then-borderline taboo topics such as abortion and homosexuality.<br/><br/>Then it started to go wrong.<br/><br/>The first blow was the departure of Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon, and the subsequent miscasting of Emma Samms in the role. Worse, the writing took a significant turn for the worse, and Samms had the double handicap of trying to compete against the memory of Martin and having distinctly inferior scripts to work with. Next, whereas previous cliffhangers had involved danger to one or two characters apiece, starting with the infamous fifth season cliffhanger, the producers decided that the majority of the cast had to be endangered in every cliffhanger - the Moldavian massacre, the fire at La Mirage, the siege of the Carrington mansion - which strained credulity to the breaking point. Once-promising characters, like Dominique and Leslie, were marginalized to the point of invisibility and eventually jettisoned with little fanfare.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the writers began to ape ratings bonanzas from previous seasons without seeming to understand why they worked in the first place. Krystle and Alexis' first catfight, for example, came at the end of slowly-increasing tension between the two over the course of the second season. Towards the end of Dynasty's run, the catfights had become almost ubiquitous, as if the writers felt that they weren't doing their job if they didn't include one every season, regardless of whether the scenes made sense from a storytelling standpoint.<br/><br/>The show enjoyed a brief renaissance in its final season, largely due to the addition of Stephanie Beacham to the cast, but with Linda Evans leaving the show in the middle of the season, it was more or less doomed at that point - the triumvirate of Blake-Krystle-Alexis, once broken, could not be repaired or replaced.<br/><br/>All in all, though, Dynasty was a pleasant way to spend an hour every Wednesday (later Thursday), and I'm glad I got to know the Carringtons.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "11 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "28 December 2010"}, {"title": " happy memories of the '80s", "content": "Dynasty was a huge favorite of myself and my friends, and I have many memories of discussing the show with them either over the phone as it was happening or the next day. The Carringtons were created to compete with the highly successful Dallas and Ewings of South Fork, but Dynasty was never a copycat show. While Dallas certainly focused on the soap opera elements common to all these programs, J.R.'s sliminess in business was a focal point. Dynasty was about obvious, over the top luxury and family with some camp elements included that made it special. What I loved about Dynasty was that, at least in the beginning, it was never camp for camp's sake - the camp was part of the show. For instance, when the casting of Fallon changed, the portrait of the old Fallon that hung over the fireplace was quietly replaced with a painting of the new one, Emma Samms, that looked like a paint by the numbers from Woolworth's. And of course, Joan Collins' Alexis had camp built right into the character. And there was Steven's plastic surgery...so many happy moments.<br/><br/>And no other show could boast the wardrobe of Dynasty, or the beauty of Linda Evans. I can still see her, bedecked in diamonds, walking toward Blake in a blue gown slit all the way up her thigh.<br/><br/>For me, once they had Alexis disguised as a nun and the whole Moldavian thing started, the show became self-conscious camp, as these shows often do, and I lost interest.

The love in this marriage (initially) goes in one direction, but Krystle is not marrying for money. Instead she is trying to forget her married lover who is permanently tied to the mentally troubled Claudia.<br/><br/>Blake's grown daughter Fallon is a promiscuous schemer. Blake's grown son Steven is sincere and gay. Remember, this is 1981 when this all starts, and twelve years later \"Don't ask don't tell\" is still considered controversial. The first season is rather a blah Dallas clone. But then at the end of the first season Blake kills Steven's lover - accidentally - and goes on trial for murder. Krystle discovers she is pregnant. And most of all \"mama\" shows up - Blake's long lost first wife, Alexis,who he divorced years ago - as a witness for the prosecution. This is no other than Joan Collins, and 25 years after her films at Fox she still can't sing, can't act, and can't dance, but wow can she can do evil camp with the best of them. She spends the next eight years being a thorn in Blake and Krystle's side, and this is the main conflict that dominates the rest of the series. Unlike Dallas, siblings Fallon and Steven get along just great and are mutually supportive - no feuding there.<br/><br/>There are mysterious disappearances, mysterious reappearances, weird alliances and odd affairs, many of which are one way romances, and of course the occasional hair-pulling cat fight between Krystle and Alexis is always rewarding, but eventually Dynasty works its way into a corner with just too many characters.

Actress Linda Evans(of \"The Big Valley\" fame)appeared in 206 out of the 220 episodes leaving the series after appearing in only six episodes of the ninth and final season. Actress Joan Collins appeared in 197 episodes of the series in Seasons 2 thru 9. Joan Collins made her debut as Alexis Carrington in the Season 2 opener \"Enter Alexis\" airing on November 4,1981. The phenomenal success of \"Dynasty\" spun the spin-off series \"The Colbys\" that ran for two seasons and 49 color episodes airing from November 11,1985 until March 26,1987.

Daddy's girl indeed, clearly this was like nothing that had ever aired before! The elaborate, preposterous plot twists, like Adam's using poison paint on Jeff's wall, were all part of the fun. The Moldavian massacre was brilliant -- practically Shakesperean as the camera pulled back to show a heap of bodies, worthy of Hamlet or MacBeth. There were however some major miscalculations, such as Emma Samms' replacing the brilliantly snippy Pamela Sue Martin. The less said about her the better. Than there was the plot twist (Steven's disappearance) that had Fallon become buddies with Krystal. \"OH Krystal!\" she wailed as they embraced. This was a really, really bad turn. The tension between those two had been one of the few things that made Krystal even moderately interesting. And it made Fallon seem dull once she teamed up with Krystal. Yecchh. Then there was Blake's evolution from a heavy into a wooden, semi-decent dullard. This, as I understand, was at John Forsythe's behest, as he didn't want to play such a heavy. MISTAKE! Bringing in new characters wasn't always so awful, I don't think. Adam became one of the show's most fun, interesting villains. Often, the show's silliest bits were its best: Paul Burke, as Cong. McVane, dressed in full drag (with wig and gown) so that he'd be mistaken for Alexis if anyone spied him tossing tennis pro Mark off the balcony -- how can you not love that?

That old witch? And she was a style icon of her time. While both she and Krystle are dressed up so extravagantly they look overblown and downright silly. The only good thing about Season 2 is, of course, Heather Locklear, who is a long way off from being Amanda Woodward in MELROSE PLACE, a show that at least understood the allure of the vixen, and didn't try to hide them to please viewers who were just ashamed to admit how they enjoyed that tigress.

Well, it happened. Go figure. I'm just starting on season 4 in spite of the series' moments of overkill, cliched melodrama and dialogue. (Try and count the number of times the phrase \"my son!\" is spit out. We get it. He's your son.) Some scenarios are not far removed from ridiculous, and for such supposedly intelligent characters, the scripts have them do some pretty stupid things----but let's be honest: the sumptuous settings and a deliciously attractive cast help us to buy all this corn, and we eat it up. As others have noted, the comparitively tame first season, with its emphasis on the Blaisdel family's ties with the Carringtons, has a very different feel from the other eight. It's quite good, but it's unlikely that iut would have sustained audience interest for too long----nothing works like excess, and after the action shifted to the various Krystle/Alexis/Blake scenarios and multiple new characters, excess was the norm. They're in new, lavish wardrobes for every scene and rarely stray far from the brandy snifter.This Eighties version is like bingeing on a big box of chocolates---you know it isn't going to improve you, but it sure pleases the senses. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find out which villain set one of those amazingly unrealistic \"movie fires\" that burn ferociously with apparently no smoke or heat....(characters in this show are barely rumpled when they go through fire, flood, car accident or plane crash.) UPDATE: Finished the last season. As lush and lavish as the series is, everything past season 5 is pretty much for die-hard fans.....it has some good things, and some ridiculous ones. As in most soaps, characters increasingly appear and disappear without warning, or are jarringly replaced by different actors--the most lamentable example being the disappearance of Pamela Sue Martin--very believable as the spoiled Fallon--who suddenly morphs into pretty but miscast Emma Samms with her often-unsuccessfully-hidden British accent. (She tries, but doesn't fully capture Fallon's moodiness and casual Western style.) As the seasons went on, 'Dynasty's writers apparently had a contest going to see who could come up with the most outlandish plots---and be warned that the series, like many others, ended up not being renewed by the network and ends on a major cliffhanger. (A tv-movie, kinda-sorta tying up some loose ends, was made a couple of years later but is hard to find.) But again, it's video candy.

The Salingers have been facing tragedy after tragedy since the day they lost their parents. This is as realistic as it gets. While Dawson's Creek and Felicity tend to escape reality every now and then, Party of Five stands out faithful to the world's reality.<br/><br/>Scott Wolf did a fantastic job portraying Bailey, especially in 1996 and 1997, during the days of his alcoholism and the following tough sobriety and subsequent management of the restaurant. He also lived through hell as he sacrificed his personal life for the sake of his family and nearly lost all faith in perfect love and affection as he dated drug addict Jill Holbrook, who killed herself with an overdose. Matthew Fox gave life to Charlie. His character suffered greatly as he took the responsibility for his siblings. It got even more dramatic when he had Hodgkin's disease, which changed his life forever. He turned from an irresponsible 24 year old to a responsible and honest 28 year old as he took care of little Diana all by himself ever since Daphne left him and her. Neve Campbell brought depth and deep emotions to Julia as the teenager grew through huge and complicated steps in her life such as her long line of relationships with Justin, Sam, Ned, Griffin and several others. She also had to deal with her pregnancy and miscarriage. Then she lived a whole year married to Griffin, which changed her deeply. After that, she was hit by Ned episode after episode until she kissed Perry Marks, which made her realize the course of her whole life in the past 5 years. Lacey Chabert is the greatest young actress ever and she changed as much as her character Claudia. From a violinist to a normal teenager, Claudia was the most affected by everything that happened in the show. Even with the constant change of young actors, Jacob Smith seems like the best actor yet to portray 5 year old Owen Salinger. He never really got to know his late parents and has seen Bailey, Charlie and Kirsten as his parents ever since. Jennifer Love-Hewitt portrayed Sarah Reeves Merrin and saw her world change as the years passed and she faced tough experiences, such as being cheated by Bailey, having discovered her orphanage and adoption, being attacked by a burglar, among several other experiences. I can't believe she may leave Party of Five next season. Paula Devicq and her character Kirsten had terrible experiences ever since she was hired as Owen's nanny. She dated Charlie, was cheated by him, got back together, nearly got married (but Charlie was afraid of commitment) and lived through a disastrous depressive state. Jeremy London also did a great job portraying Griffin. At first he seemed to be just Julia's boyfriend, but he made a character out of himself as he faced tough situations such as leaving his father, losing his sister Jill, being arrested twice and breaking up with Julia.<br/><br/>There were great recurring players in the show as well. Michael Goorjian did a great job with Justin from 1995 to 1996. Tamara Taylor did a fantastic job, portraying Grace Wilcox in 1996 and 1997. Alexondra Lee's performance as Callie was magnific, which made her a regular for the whole season (1996-1997). Carrol O'Connor did a good job as Grandpa Jake, but his storyline was cut short. I don't understand why he left the show. His disease wasn't a good excuse at the 1996 christmas. Paige Turco was the best of them all when she portrayed Annie Mott along with young Allison Bertolino as little Natalie from 1997 to 1998. Paige brought Annie the full force she also brought to her NYPD Blue gay character Abby Sullivan.

Starting off, I believe it was 6 months or so after a couple is killed by a drunk driver they leave behind 5 children to care for themselves. The oldest in which was Charlie (Matt fox), was about 24yrs old or so. He had to take charge and keep his family together so they weren't split up in to foster homes. He was an average guy who liked girls and to drink and have fun. But was all of a sudden made a father of 4 kids in an instant. Next, was Bailey (Scott Wolf) about 16yrs old and throughout the series had many problems with things such as drinking, girls, and of course raising a family. In many ways Bailey was the adult. He was a take charge type person inwhich had to grow up very fast, like no sixteen year old should have to do. I could relate to Bailey's character in many ways in my own life, even though I don't drink and probably never will, I have more fun without. Now we come to Julia (Neve Campbell) she is about 15 yrs old and is going through a time in her life inwhich no girl shouldn't have a mother to talk to. Of course, she makes many mistakes such as having sex for the first time drunk at Charlie's wedding or at least we hoped would be his wedding. She also was abused by a boyfriend later on inwhich she defended his action's, but deep down knew that she needed out of that situation. She went through a lot during the 6 yrs it was on, but was a absolute wonderful character and I don't believe anyone else could of done it as well as Neve did. And now we come to child number four Claudia (Lacey Chabert) which I believe had it the hardest in many ways she is about 12yrs old and her life has changed for ever in an instant. She is such a sweet and curious girl. Lacey is so natural as an actress and I believe she will be around for as long as she likes. In her own life i'm sure being in the spotlight of millions of viewers while growing up literally in front of us had to be a difficult thing. Now the youngest of the five is Owen (Jacob Smith) inwhich was played by more then one actor when younger, but I remember him best because he had more story line during the last season or two. He was about 6 months old when the show started so he wouldn't have any memories of his parents just what his siblings tell him and from photo's. This was a great series and I would like to see a reunion movie in the future, but know that that cast will not be doing that anytime soon.

I think Neve was the best actor on the show, and has managed to pull off roles in a diverse range of films like the 'Scream' horror trilogy, disco flick '54', the bad girl in 'Wild Things', ditzy girlfriend in 'Three To Tango', and a witch in 'The Craft'. Neve is a brilliant young actress who is getting better with every role.<br/><br/>Younger sister Claudia was acted out by Lacey Chabert. Although many said her voice was whiny, Lacey grew up on the show and has had her own animated series 'The Wild Thornberrys' aswell as voicing a lion cub in 'The Lion King 2' (along with Neve) aswell as starring in the 1998 flick 'Lost In Space'.<br/><br/>The fifth member Owen, was only a baby when the show started, and has been played by numerous twins.

Famous for her roles in 'Can't Hardly Wait', 'Heartbreakers' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', Love did an excellent job of playing Sarah, Bailey's on-again, off-again girlfriend (what is with this bunch?).<br/><br/>After battling Parkinson's disease, cancer, relationship troubles, money troubles, college troubles, family troubles and more, the Salingers said goodbye last year for the final time.", "rating": null, "helpful": "12 out of 18 found this helpful.", "date": "24 September 2001"}, {"title": " if not *the* best, one of the best....", "content": ".....drama TV shows today...maybe of all time.

The show starts with a bit of an unusual premise where 5 siblings, ranging from a baby to a 24 years old, are left alone when their parents die in a car accident and need to live their life taking care of each other.<br/><br/>The show has kind of soapy themes but they still manage to show them in a pretty realistic way. This is thanks to amazing writing and acting. Not one episode felt to be below average to me, only very few were average and the majority were outstanding. I am glad it didn't get cancelled after the first season. Even though it didn't have a high rating at first the fans managed to keep it on air and I am thankful to them for that pleasure. It is also good that it ended after 6 seasons as it would probably go down in quality after that. But we got to enjoy a lot of stories on their relationships., Charlie's cancer and Bailey's alcoholism.<br/><br/>The characters are well done and developed. I loved Matthew Fox as Charlie. He shows so well his development from being a regular 24 year old who wants to have fun and is stuck with his siblings to a guy who made all the sacrifices to his family, loved them and managed to put his life on the path he wanted to. All his struggles and mistakes are shown in a very humane way. I don't get how people can not connect to Charlie. And he is my favorite of Matthew Fox's roles now, I like him better than on Lost where I first got to know him.<br/><br/>Scott Wolf also makes a great job as Bailey. Sometimes he is annoying because he acts way older than his age but we remember that this is also because he had to grow up so fast. And he manages to make the character sympathetic even when he does bad things. His struggle with alcohol was also very realistic.<br/><br/>Neve Campbell as Julia was actually my least favorite character of them. But she was still wonderful and did great acting. I just couldn't connect to most of her stories. But this is how it is, one can't always love every single character. The good thing is that I also never really disliked her.<br/><br/>Lacey Chabert as Claudia was my favorite in the beginning. She didn't become worse later but her as a very witty, sensible and courageous child was a great period. She always went on missions such as finding their grandpa or meet the man who killed their parents in the accident. Loved her family and dealt with her growing up as well as she could having only her siblings to help her. As well as Ross who sure was a great role model to her.<br/><br/>Besides the main characters we have some outstanding support characters that help us to enjoy the show. Sarah, Will, Justin, Griffin, Kirsten, Ross. I could say a lot about all of them but I will just stick to the fact that they were all well developed, portrayed and played a huge support to the Salingers when they needed them.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "4 out of 5 found this helpful.", "date": "15 April 2018"}, {"title": " Interactive drama!", "content": "I fell in love with Party of Five after I caught the last 10 minuets of the second episode when it first aired. I was an extremely awkward 12 year old and I had just started 7th grade. I was completely in love with Scott Wolf. I wrote him fan letters and bought every teen magazine with him in it, that I could get my hands on. I had falsely remembered that I had been obsessed with the first season but then quit watching it after. I was so jealous of Sara that I couldn't even watch. Oh my god! I was a weird child. I received the first season on DVD for my 23rd birthday. Because I thought that this was the only good season I was content only watching that one, over and over again every so often.<br/><br/>Then, earlier this year I bought the 3rd season on itunes. I was really just bored and thought it would be mildly entertaining. All of the sudden, I remembered that I did watch it when it first aired. By then I was a Freshman in high school. I remembered that I would pop in to watch it every now and then because the commercials kept making it seem like Bailey and Sara were going to break up. I remember being totally disgusted and almost heartbroken that Bailey had turned into an alcoholic. Now, I myself, am a recovering alcoholic. I have to say that the entire season is a very honest account of all the emotions, good, bad, and ugly, that go in to alcoholism. I commend the writers for letting a heartbreaking story happen to such a beloved character. That is exactly what alcoholism does. I think back to the horror, anger, and sadness that I felt towards Bailey back in the 9th grade and I am reminded of the way I felt about my self. It helps to bring everything full circle and to get an outside view, a glimpse at what it's like to watch someone hate themselves so much. For anyone struggling, there is hope. I have been sober for 3 years, but I have not only recovered from alcoholism but from a general frustration with yourself and life. That's what so honest about this show. Bailey's problems begin before he gets into too much trouble. This is because things aren't going his way. Alcohol at that point is his solution. That is why people feel so much guilt about their problems, even today when it is largely accepted as a disease. They feel like they have chosen the wrong solution, but it was the only one? Anyway. It is also super real how by the end of the season he is always drunk but you never see him drinking.

The entirety of all seasons have the most impeccable writing and direction I have ever seen in a low budget television show. Each episode comes with a different genre to the last that follows the common tropes of said genre. However the real pay off for each episode is the dark twist that relates to either the characters, location or narrative... or all three. This provides an excellent re-watch value that gives the series its impressive hook.<br/><br/>Although each episode has its own characteristic element that makes it fantastic, each season still contains episodes that are so impeccable that it requires a second watch to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>Within season one, my personal favourite was Episode 2, A Quiet Night In. This episode is a brilliant creation of a small heist drama, however the brilliant element of the episode is how there is no exposition spoken throughout the episode. How Pemberton and Shearsmith interact using only body language builds an impressive comedic element of the episode, this allows for our expectations of the episodes final act to be turned on their heads.<br/><br/>Season 2 contains one of, if not the most outstanding episode of not just Inside No. 9, but British TV as a whole. Episode 2, The 12 Days of Christine follows Christine as she goes through what appears to be her day to day life. Upon the first watch, most of the little details go by without the viewer taking much notice (This is common throughout Inside No. 9!) it's not until the final part of the show where it all comes together. This episode drew the biggest emotional impact from myself throughout all of Inside No. 9. The ending, that was built up to in all the little details of the episode, delivers a heart stopping twist that will bring a tear to even the strongest of hearts. This episode should be hailed as a holy text and studied in schools for the rest of time. I cannot explain how perfect the writing to this episode is. Overall, season two was a dramatic increase from season one, possibly due to a higher budget or Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith being allowed to reach their creative limits.<br/><br/>Season 3 seemed to be the season Pembeeton and Shearsmith decided to create multiple different genres in the season. It ranges from a comedy over a restaurant bill to a director reviewing an old 80's movie. My personal favourite was episode 3, The Riddle of the Spinx. Something about this episode drove me to watch it 3 or 4 times, showing each of my family members with a giddy feeling in my belly. The plot to this episode is entirely written into a cryptic crossword, every twist, every move, every characters roll is derived by what the crossword says. I feel everything is in this episode. Even Shakespeare has a mention in this episode. Although this episode is not as emotionally captivating as the 12 days of Christine in season 2. I believe the cryptic writing of this episode is the strongest of all seasons.<br/><br/>Finally I come onto season 4. For me this season had a fantastic first 3 episodes, but the plot of the final 3 drop in comparison to the first half. Episode 1, Zanzibar, is an episode that is fully written in iambic pentameter. The episode follows the packed floor of number 9 in the British Hotel Zanzibar. The acting from the two writers Rory Kinnear and all the cast is fantastic. It feels as the most enjoyable to watch episode for me as all the exposition rolls along like a song. I don't want to explain any of the plot as I feel this episode is best to go into blind, but all I will say is 'Spaghetti Bolognese'.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside No. 9 is, what I believe, the best writing a human can create. Each episode is as good as the last (excluding certain episodes) and each episode is so easy to watch and take in. If you like television, you will love this. Every person I have shown this to has watched the entire series within a few weeks of me showing them.

With this new series, they retain the comedy with horror undercurrents basic idea but with each separate episode being a standalone teleplay. All stories occur in a place with the address no. 9. The format is such that the action in each instalment never moves from the one location. It reflects that these have been made on a pretty tight budget but despite this the writing is good and the cast does include several respected actors such as Katherine Parkinson, Denis Lawson and Gemma Arteton; Pemberton and Shearsmith themselves are of course brilliant character actors themselves and appear throughout the series too.<br/><br/>Season One:<br/><br/>Sardines \u2013 in a large country house, a game of sardines is played, resulting in everyone ending up in a wardrobe in one of the bedrooms. This is a claustrophobic opener.<br/><br/>Tom &amp; Gerri \u2013 a man enters a downward spiral when he befriends a mysterious tramp. This episode is the best of the series. A genuinely dark tale.<br/><br/>A Quiet Night In \u2013 a couple of bugling burglars try to steal a painting from a luxury home. This is I guess the experimental episode. It plays out effectively like a silent movie.<br/><br/>Last Gasp \u2013 a pop star dies while making a home visit to a sick girl, his entourage and the family then squabble over a balloon which holds his dying breath. This is the weakest episode, with a definite lack of material.<br/><br/>The Understudy \u2013 an acting understudy eventually assumes centre stage but at a price. This one is an interesting atmospheric tale.<br/><br/>The Harrowing \u2013 a teenage girl is hired to house sit but it appears that there are scary things going on in this home. This is the most clearly horror influenced segment. It has interesting things going for it but it doesn't really amount to as much as it could.<br/><br/>Overall, the first season is good but not a great one. As a comedy it's really not all that funny, surprisingly so when you take into account just how hilarious The League of Gentlemen was. But to be fair, I don't honestly think they were going for laughs a lot of the time, quite often it seemed like it was the dark tone that was the main idea. Ultimately pretty uneven but certainly an interesting bit of work though.<br/><br/>Season Two:<br/><br/>La Couchette - a group of passengers share a Trans Europe sleeper carriage in a train where something very bad happens in the night. A good start to season two that benefits from some fine comic performances from a good cast of TV familiars. This one is quite a bit more obviously funny than most in the series.<br/><br/>The 12 Days of Christine - twelve key days in the life of a woman called Christine. I reckon that this has to go down as the best episode in all of 'Inside No. 9'. In fact, this is one of the best bits of television I can remember seeing for a long while. In half an hour, this fantastically constructed episode conveys a huge amount of genuine emotion in an interesting and original way. Sheridan Smith is quite brilliant here also.<br/><br/>The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge - two witch finders arrive at a village in order to interrogate a woman accused of witch-craft. The influence of the 17th century horror films of the British film studio Tigon is very much in evidence. A little more straightforward than most in season two, yet very satisfying all the same.<br/><br/>Cold Comfort - a new volunteer worker at a Samaritans phone line experiences a series of unpleasant events. Once again this is an episode that shows huge invention on the part of its creators. Shot from a permanent split-screen that shows the views of three static in-house cameras, the story is expertly told and uses this restriction to its benefit even if the final pay-off is perhaps slightly under-par.<br/><br/>Nana's Party - events at a family birthday party go from bad to worse. This one is typified by lots of psychological tensions maximised by a set of oddball characters that don't seem to know how to socially interact.<br/><br/>S\u00e9ance Time - a bad tempered TV prankster gets more than he bargained for during a mock s\u00e9ance he set up. Like the final episode of season one, this is another that goes for a horror styling in a much more overt manner. Once again it works well, as a result of some strong acting, even if it isn't ultimately the best work of the series.<br/><br/>In summary, season two was a blinder and, for my money, noticeably stronger that season one. I think Shearsmith and Pemberton have really got into their stride here and there really aren't any weak episodes in this second batch at all.

On top of this with the format regularly shifting from comedy, to horror to drama and episodes often being dark or whimsical it becomes quite impossible to have any idea what path it is going to take from the outset with the ending either playing out as one big punch line or one horrifying realisation regardless of how funny or dark the rest of the episode was.<br/><br/>Also impressive is the ability to generally set each story in such a confined space without it becoming claustrophobic or boring as is often the case with bottle episodes. Often achieving this through the use of interesting styles and settings like a lack of dialogue or playing around with the flow of time in the story which in itself would make for excellent episodes even if there were no cleverness to the story. So much intrigue and character is packed into every scene that you feel as if you could probably watch for hours without tiring of the repetitive setting.<br/><br/>Some episodes really are genius whilst a few are a little weaker but make it no less watchable but as a series because they keep you guessing and only make you appreciate the next episode all the more. I admit I almost gave up on the series during the first episode when it was described as comedy but was a little tedious and not overly funny but I am glad I didn't because episode by episode it has only become more engrossing, funnier, darker and ever perplexing.<br/><br/>The one drawback it has being quite so clever is it will never be as re-watchable as the League of Gentlemen or Psychoville unless you use electroshock therapy (or just bang your head against a wall) to erase the outcomes from your mind... so I can only hope they're able to keep it going for a few more series before the universe's supply of creativity is depleted.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "20 December 2017"}, {"title": " great", "content": "It's a great anthology series.

I've been a fledgling student, to a drop out, to now a person getting his Ph.D. I've seen so many students walk through the doors of Universites with a diploma in their hand and I can't help but think how much their lives seemed a lot like A Different World. Despite the silliness of the show, college, for many of my friends (and now my students), deals with the 3 same conflicting natures that were depicted in the show: 1) making a name for yourself, 2) finding what you really want out of life and 3) connecting to your roots. They hit on those universal themes (just like Spike Lee did with School Daze, which, curiously enough, could be read as the precursor to A Different World). I think it's one of the few shows that tried to show what it was like for a person of color to go through the university system. Shows like Class of 1995 or Felicity attempt to show college life, but this show really does hit on those points that are important. Even now it seems more fresh and more biting than most comedies.<br/><br/>I think the key to this show was that the humor masked the depth and the character progression of the actors in the show.

Imagine \"Scott and Bailey\" on steroids. Refreshingly free from the usual macho bullsh*t that cop show writers seem to think is obligatory,\"No offence\" centres round three women detectives,two of whom are smart,tough and clever and one of whom is clever but not smart enough to know that cleverness isn't enough in what is still predominantly a man's world. The first episode starts off with an extraordinary sequence where an off - duty woman detective spots a wanted man and chases him.In attempting to escape he is hit by a coach that runs over his head. Horror -stricken she leaves the scene,hoping no one had seen her. This is a straight if beefed - up steal from \"Scott and Bailey\",but \"hommage\" is a perfectly acceptable device providing it is not over - used e.g \"The delivery man\" slavishly following in \"Green Wing\"'s footsteps.

A young girl leaving the A&amp;E dept with facial injuries is mistaken for a Down syndrome sufferer and kidnapped.

Not surprising as it certainly encapsulates the irreverent northern British attitude to life. No messing about, sod the risk and get it done, break a few rules if you have to - and have a laugh while doing it. It's a strong flavour, so I shouldn't be surprised at the odd marmite response. I hope that most people love it too? If you're expecting Morse or Scott &amp; Bailey you will be offended, that's the intent. <br/><br/>This show turns every stereo type on its head. Paul Abbott brought us 'Shameless' - a joyful, unapologetic celebration of the council estate underclass and all of their faults. Faults that can actually be strengths in the long run; and he's done it again with a huge dollop of 'Girl Power' for want of a better phrase. Shameless' strongest characters were the women, they were the family glue, doers and problem solvers. No Offense is far more overt. The girls haven't only learned to drive, they own the bloody car so get out of the way or you're getting rammed!<br/><br/>Most of the characters smashing in the headlights are women. Yet this is no Cagney &amp; Lacey - I haven't seen one bit of designer knitwear yet. This is not a cynical attempt to capture 'the female demographic' at prime time like the 80's New York Cop show, quite the opposite.<br/><br/>There's the soft centred yet canny, hard as Blackpool rock and ferocious boss, DI Deering (Joanna Scanlan) who prefers the ladies loo to an office for a briefing. And the absolute opposite, recently promoted virgin in a brothel DS Joy Freers (Alexandra Roach, Utopia)who obviously feels she shouldn't have been promoted at all but is going to find a back bone and earn it. Stuck in the middle and the one that should have been promoted is the level headed, capable, ultra brave and prone to wrong decisions, DC Kowalska (Elaine Cassidy). Her unfortunate and accidental squishing of a murderer's skull with the help of a bus ruled her out of the detective sergeant's spot. Was it wrong for me to laugh so much that I didn't need an enema? 'No', says Paul, 'It's okay'. We are given a wealth of characters, with an insight into their off duty and totally unguessable private lives. There are too many good actors to mention;even those with a a few lines are already making their presence known.<br/><br/>It's not just about gender and tearing up some stereotypes. I'm happy with the supporting role of tough yet deferential DC Spike Tanner (Will Mellor - 2 Pints Of lager And A Packet Of Crisps) who comes across as big brother to his even bigger sisters; and the seen it all still smiling despite a banging hangover Miller. I'm not sure of his job. Teckie? Forensic pathologist? This enigmatic role is meat and gravy for Paul Ritter. He's also kicking backside with his 'petrified of being outed' political animal MI5 spy master in 'The Game' (BBC).<br/><br/>The underlying plot that will run 'til the end is the hunt for a serial killer preying on young girls with Downs Syndrome. The subplots are many motley yet major crimes, about one an episode, which is enough to give variety as well as depth. Human nature and the motivations that make people 'bad' seem to be a theme, however I'm only three shows in, maybe it's not. <br/><br/>Comedy is born of tragedy and the tragedy here is that the perverted killer's victims are the most innocent and vulnerable of all God's creatures. Pure pathos. Yet no one is made to feel guilty about the laugh out loud moments despite the serious subject. Having come from a police family with a few burnt out alcoholic wrecks as testament to an often traumatic, thankless job I can understand and even vouch for the humour. It's a coping mechanism to make light of something that would put some of us in a mad house. Example;<br/><br/>There was a suicide on the rail line near us. An uncle attended along with others including firemen. They found the victim strewn along the track. But they just couldn't find the head, the last remaining piece and possibly crucial for ID as it was way before DNA profiling. The search went on for hours until finally a fireman found it in an adjacent field. To announce the discovery he picked it up by the hair, looked it in the eye and said 'You won't do that again, will you'?! Those close enough to hear cracked up. That's the dark humour, Paul Abbott has found the head. <br/><br/>Thanks Paul. You and (let's not forget 'em, they love to break the rules too) Channel 4 deserve a big, hearty thanks and many awards.<br/><br/>As I said, this is meaty, feisty Marmite doing a power riff; not a limp and bland cucumber sandwich accompanied by strings on an idyllic English lawn.<br/><br/>Can anyone smell toast?<br/><br/>IT'S FINISHED NOW!

Each new season of a show or each new show of theirs I watch I'm stunned at not just the production quality of the show but the originality of the stories being told. With the release of NO OFFENCE SERIES 1 they tackle a group that is rarely discussed or shown in any television shows and in most shown only as helpless. That's people with Down syndrome. As someone with a family member who has this the series held a personal interest for me. <br/><br/>The story here takes place in Manchester and focuses on the detective bureau of the fictional Manchester Metropolitan Police. D.C. Dinah Kowalska (Elaine Cassidy) has just missed out on a promotion and her colleague DS Joy Freers (Alexandra Roach) has been chosen for the post. The head of the squad, DI Vivienne Deering (Joana Scanlon) explains her reasoning to Dinah but soon that's shelved as a case comes in. <br/><br/>Investigating a drowning incident of a young woman with Down syndrome, Dinah connects the death to another case that was similar. As she puts the pieces of the puzzle together it appears that there is a serial killer on the loose and his focus is on women with Down syndrome. The investigation eventually leads to a prime suspect but finding enough evidence to be certain and to convict is something else altogether. In addition to that, as the series moves forward we begin to wonder if any of the suspects the present is the actual killer or if it's someone else. Each episode provides information but at the same time has you guessing.<br/><br/>In addition to the main focus of the eight part series other crimes are investigated as well. There is also the drama of police political interference going on from the start as one higher up demands to take over the investigation from those who found the case to begin with. It doesn't stop the team here from following up on their own and eventually getting the case handed back to them.<br/><br/>There is also the story of one of the potential victims, a young woman saved before she was murdered. In this case the killer made an error and the girl in question didn't have Down syndrome at all but appeared so because of facial surgery she'd just had. Surviving she becomes the only potential witness to the murderer but suffers from a mind block that prevents her from recalling details. Coming from a home of drug addicts adds to the problem and Dinah takes her under her wing to help.<br/><br/>The series works on all levels here. The characters as written all have their pluses and minuses. I know myself by the end of the first episode I couldn't stand the character of Vivienne but by the end she was the most thought out character of the bunch. Other members of the team have personal problems that at times interfere with their work. Some have interpersonal relations at work that cause problems. Each has more depth than most in a series like this.<br/><br/>But those characters would amount to very little in the hands of actors who weren't at the top of their game. Fortunately each and every actor in this drama is superb, down to what might be considered a bit part. Scanlon is amazing as the brash, mouthy boss who rules with an iron fist but is filled with compassion at the same time. Cassidy does a great job of showing the hardnosed officer who has that soft spot in her that needs attention. And Roach does a great job of appearing to be in over her head only to show she has what it takes for her new role at the station.<br/><br/>As I said from the start there is a certain amount of twistedness that goes with their chosen storyline here, a serial killer who targets Down syndrome women. Not only is he killing them he's raping them as well, a particularly heinous crime in anyone's book. It makes we the viewer look at each suspect with a high level of disgust until their innocence can be proven. That someone would do such a thing is stomach churning. <br/><br/>While extras don't amount to much that doesn't matter. What does is a solid series with 8 episodes that will leave you wanting more.

Why do you think that is?\" Kenneth Brannagh's shambling, weary detective Kurt Wallander is as far from TV's 'Columbo' as it's possible to get, despite certain physical similarities.<br/><br/>In a way that I seem to recognise as uniquely Nordic, Wallander goes about his daily business \u2013 solving murders \u2013 with a residual sadness on him and his world, and everything in the show \u2013 from the art-house photography and pared-down sets, to the score, to his life and to each episode's stories themselves \u2013 helps create a consistent portrait, so that by the time I settled down for episode two, Wallander's appearance was an automatic trigger to a certain state of mind.<br/><br/>Each classy episode takes its time, draws visual comparisons, sets Wallander up in his world, makes you know him better. I'm loving it : it's on a par with the excellent French TV thriller \"Engrenages\" that previously appeared on BBC4, and anything ever so slightly formulaic about the story lines in each episode is offset by the serious and committed acting, the well-drawn characterisation, the consistent visual tone. I'm so glad they avoided the Meryl Streep world of accents and wholesale removal of the drama to the UK (or USA). These are Swedish characters in a Swedish town who write in Swedish \u2013 it's just that we're hearing them in English. And this technique allows them to cast truly excellent English supporting actors without any fear of uneven accents or geographic transitions that don't work so well. (No English forest ever looks quite like a Scandinavian one. And the British don't so much do sadness and mournful humour, as bleakness and black humour \u2013 they're quite different.)<br/><br/>I saw Kenneth Brannagh as an electrifying 'Hamlet' on stage in the late 80s, and this feels something like being reacquainted with an old ghost.

For the most part Swedish Wallander uses Mankel's stories as inspiration, creating unique plots per episode, whilst British Wallander uses the source material and thus far has for the most part faithfully adapted 6 of Mankel's books (interestingly the choice has been to adapt out of sequence, although the original stories were also published out of sequence, in Britian at least). An exception is the depiction of Kurt's father and his struggle with dementia, which logically has to progress through the overall TV series.<br/><br/>A second key difference is the interpretation of Kurt Wallander's relationship with his daughter. Swedish TV puts Linda into the police force from the outset, and uses this device to explore their legendary troubled relationship with the added frisson of professional, hierarchical tensions. Also into the mix is the relationship between Linda and her colleague Stefan Lindman. British Wallander maintains the original Linda/Kurt story arc, with Linda not yet having enrolled for police duty.<br/><br/>A third difference is the inclusion/exclusion of the Ann-Britt H\u00f6glund character. It seems the Swedish version quickly came to view this character as unnecessary within the looser story structure, as she is dispensed with well before Series One concludes. For British TV H\u00f6glund remains integral, just as she is in the books.<br/><br/>However, setting aside these givens, there are a number of factors which set the two interpretations apart in terms of quality, success and viewer experience. British Wallander is quite pacey, moving the story along briskly from scene to scene. Whilst this mostly works, it does occasionally occur at the expense of scene and/or character development - the camera (and therefore the viewer) is forced to follow Kurt, leaving other characters as cyphers. This is most notable during scenes with colleagues at police HQ. Swedish Wallander adopts a slower style, allowing characters and stories to develop and unfold with greater subtlety. This approach leads to a second and quite fundamental difference, and it is this element that underlines the superiority of the Swedish Wallander. The combination of writing, direction and editing for a slower pace allows the Swedish actors to effectively 'do less' and achieve more. Accordingly, Henricksson, Bergman, S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, Rapace et al are repeatedly given the time and direction to use economy and skill to enable the viewer to understand what they are thinking, feeling etc. The final episode of Series One was a particular example of this, with all concerned but particularly S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m and Henricksson underplaying beautifully to create scenes of desperate sadness, bewilderment and loss whilst actually 'doing' very little. In comparison, a combination of misjudged casting and actors being let down by script and scene construction in the British version means for the most part the viewer receives less reward. Branagh, Warner and most notably McCabe as Nyberg are the exceptions, the former not least because Wallander remains the prime focus through the British drama, and is therefore given more time, scene-by-scene, and Warner because he is quite simply an experienced and clever film actor. Yet it is McCabe who shines, underplaying beautifully, especially during scenes in Episode 4 - The Faceless Killers.<br/><br/>Views on casting are always contentious. Suffice to say, the Swedish series has somehow managed to secure a host of clever actors who know a thing or two about camera work, and particularly scenes in close-up. From the moments of occasional humour gratefully received from M\u00f6rck's Ebba and Gunnarsson's Svartman (an incidental and unsung masterpiece of a performance) to the brilliance of Henricksson and S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, it's the Swedish production which holds the treats and subtleties and warrants repeat viewings.<br/><br/>The British Wallander is indeed watchable, but let's hope the BBC transmits Series 2 of the Swedish production as soon as possible, and let's also hope the absence of Rapace and S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m doesn't diminish what has been an excellent television production.", "rating": 6, "helpful": "41 out of 56 found this helpful.", "date": "16 January 2010"}, {"title": " Swedish Equivalent of England's Inspector Morse Crime mysteries", "content": "Wallander is a British television series adapted from the Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander novels &amp; starring Kenneth Branagh as the depressed gloomy police inspector (who is also separated from his wife).

Are things really that desperate in BBC television land?

It makes about as much sense as Swedish television making a carbon copy of Midsommer Murders, spoken in Swedish. It really is head scratching stuff.<br/><br/>Surely then, given the bizarreness of the premise, the only possible remaining justification for hijacking the Wallander character and anglicising him must be that they are going to do something different and groundbreaking with him.

Check.<br/><br/>I have never read the Wallander books or seen the Swedish TV series, but given that Kenneth Brannagh went to so much trouble to get the author of the novels to agree to doing this series you might have thought the Wallander character was something truly exceptional and supremely rewarding for an actor of his calibre. Based on the first episode I can report that in fact Wallander as portrayed in this series is simply the usual cut-out character, of no interest, and what's even worse, supremely incompetent at his job. In the first episode he is singlehandedly responsible for the totally avoidable deaths of two young people, presumably so we can see how \"human\" and affected he is, which is, I gather, is Wallander's \"claim to fame\". Death number 1 - ridiculously a young girl is in the middle of a field of tall yellow flowers. How she came to be there, and why, we never find out. Not only that, she turns out to have possibly the largest can of petrol in the world. Because if you want to kill yourself you would intuitively go miles into the country to a large field of yellow flowers and choose the most ridiculous way of killing yourself, right? Even without the petrol can we can all see that this girl is on the edge, but that does not stop our hero from barging in like a complete klutz, resulting in the girl killing herself. At the end of the episode, having contrived to lure the killer into a trap, not only do 4 police fail to intercept the culprit before he gets to his prey, but despite having minutes to do so, are unable to disarm him and Wallander ends up shoot him dead. You can see now why his name is Wallander for evidently he is a complete Wally. Not only does he needlessly kill a 15 year old boy, but a boy who is not a villain, but doing what he thought was right.<br/><br/>At no time does Wallander show any signs of good leadership, good judgment, or good detective work. We are left wondering how on earth he came to be in the position of leading a police team, and how they could possibly have any respect for him - he has no presence, no charisma, he is just an emotional, angry little man. He gets angry with witnesses and does and says stupid things that would see him fired in a heartbeat in real life.<br/><br/>Of course in his team we have all the usual suspects. A woman with no apparent function but who is the latest recipient of the \"Broadchurch award for worst hairdo\", taking over from Ellie Miller. Apparently she has lost her hairbrush and is now doing her hair with a blender. Meanwhile another woman of unknown function exchanges many furtive glances with our hero Wallander.

The music track is also burdened with a title theme featuring a \"sensitive singer-songwritery\" voice crooning words that do not appear to have anything at all to do with the story (or even have any coherent meaning) in typical alt/pop fashion. Once in each episode there is a collegial meeting in which Our Hero bursts into angry shouting and storms out of the room only to be followed by his boss who tenderly suggests he go home and have a nice lay down.

Instead Wallander feels as if it has been done the other way around, like a typical British TV crime drama transplanted to Sweden. The actors' curiously stilted and accent-less English often grates on the ear and the use of Swedish names and places requires the same suspension of disbelief required to listen to dubbed films. It also makes it difficult for the actors to flesh out their characters or make them entirely believable in a Swedish context.<br/><br/>Much of the time, Branagh and co. simply aren't convincing as police officers, and sound more like a group of Oxbridge academics conducting a research project rather than police engaged in a murder inquiry. The series is also limited in that it has been written too much as a vehicle for Branagh, and the other characters are marginalized to the point when they barely have any individual life at all.<br/><br/>All this is very different from the Swedish original, where even the regular minor characters became important components of the storyline, with tensions and relationships that were were clearly established, and where crimes were solved, not just because of Wallander's moments of individual genius, but through teamwork and collaboration and the gradual accumulation of small details.<br/><br/>And for all his moody, unshaven portrayal of a driven and traumatized detective haunted by his job and his personal demons, Branagh's performance pales in comparison with his Swedish counterpart Krister Henriksson.<br/><br/>Henriksson's Wallander had a complexity, humanity and nobility that is lacking in Branagh's more one-dimensional performance.

But in this BBC version, it seems a deliberate attempt has been made to change the script. Kenneth Brannagh plays Wallander as a quiet, depressed man, seemingly devoid of any charisma or natural authority, lost in his own existential woes; the force of Morse's personality is not in any way apparent. The direction of the series tends to the filmic as well, breaking from the step-by-step approach of the classic television detective story and preferring a more impressionistic, atmospheric approach. Personally, I'm not so convinced that either of these innovations work - Brannagh's permanent internal grief grates and does not convince (most people learn to wear a mask on their misery as a prerequisite for survival), while I didn't always find it possible to follow the details of the plots. There's also a certain innate problem of having English actors, speaking English, playing Swedes; if one is looking for insight into the Scandinavian character, one won't find it here. The final problem, the improbably complex actions of the killers in each story, is innate to the source material.

After seven episodes, I'm convinced: it's the latter, and then some.<br/><br/>Each episode has been better than the last. Dark Matter is showing the same strengths that made Stargate SG-1 and it's spin-offs so addictive. Strong, likable characters. Solid performances by actors you may not have seen a lot of times before. Story lines that often seem breezy and lightweight, yet conceal a lot of clever writing - courtesy of Mallozzi and Mullie, two of the key writers on Stargate.<br/><br/>The most recent episode is a great example. The crew finds an 'entertainment android' and assembles it. What follows is a nice bit of fencing with our preconceptions. Yes, the android can perform sex - and we get the predictable jokes. But it can also cook, which is far more important, given the crew's short rations. And it also harbors some nasty surprises. The story mixes humor, suspense and even tragedy. Sure, it's 'just' traditional space opera. But space opera deftly handled, to the point where it becomes absolutely compelling.<br/><br/>This is all the more amazing, considering the less-than-promising concept upon which Dark Matter is based: a crew wakes up on a starship, with no memory of who they are. It sounds like a recipe for cookie-cutter tedium. But four or five episodes later, this collection of apparent stereotypes has become a tight group of multifaceted characters, just as likable as Stargate's Jack O'Neill, Daniel Jackson and Sam Carter. I really didn't think Mallozzi and Mullie could pull it off. But they not only did it, they did it in fewer episodes than I could have imagined.<br/><br/>No, this is not Shakespeare. It's unapologetic genre fiction. If you found Stargate SG-1 too corny, or too silly, then forget Dark Matter. But if you've got a place in your heart for sci-fi adventure painted boldly on a huge canvas, Dark Matter is a must-watch. Don't give up after one or two episodes - give it a chance to build, and it won't disappoint.<br/><br/>The only possible downside is the originating network: SyFy.

When I first started watching Dark Matter I was concerned that this was another low budget flop being streamed by Netflix. There are a number of amateurish sci fi movies and programs on Netflix so I was thinking this may be another. \nRegarding tropes there is the use of amnesia as a plot device and an Asian martial arts expert from a quasi-Samurai-ish planet. Over time I forgave the amnesia plot device because the writers used it to explore numerous issues reminiscent of Black Mirror. Most interestingly is the issue of how past trauma informs our decisions and sense of identity. Ultimately, the crew decide to not \"upload\" there memories for fear of becoming the people they once were after realizing they wanted to continue doing good in the universe rather than returning to the criminal past. This and a number of explorations of memory, lived experience, and sense of identity brought this tired trope into a more relevant story-line.\nHowever, the Samurai planet still is quite irkesome. Was the planet settled by a Live Action Role Play cult. Why would a future society base itself on an innacurate and fictional version of Japan's past. Were the founders of this society trying to emulate a martial arts trope. There is never any explanation unlike a show like Firefly where the Wild West motif made sense in the show's back story.\nHowever, with that said almost every episode has a whodunit storyline and there are numerous whodunit story arcs. There are numerous \"Professor Plum in the study with a candlestick\" moments that are weirdly satisfying.\nMany of the episodes and storylines seem to be lifted directly from old murder mystery shows or Twilight Zone episodes that are then spacified. This too is weirdly satisfying.\nDespite the wooden dialogue the characters are complex. They explore sci fi territory such as time travel, robot sentience, technological disparities among competing societies, intrstellar governance, economics between worlds, and alternate realities. These topics are dealt with in a unique way sometimes ending up with different conclusions than other franchises. I especially enjoyed the time travel episode that rejected the Star Trek universes Prime Directive assumption that the actions in a past timeline will create an alternate timeline. Instead they explore the Game of Thrones perspective that the past is already written and any action in the past by someone in the future already happened. Also, they don't beat the viewer over the head with the writer's ingenuity. They just leave the concept there and move on with the plot. It took me half an hour to explain this complex reverse paradox concept, but the writers did not feel compelled to provide exposition to spoon feed it to you.\nDark Matter delivers all the low brow action and character development necessary for a good sci fi show. Additionally, there is a lot of original ideas never previously explored by other sci fi writers wrapped up in structures that at first glance appear somewhat recycled from other shows. The use of previous explored storylines is used as a device to set the viewer up to question their ultimate assumptions. \nThe show ends on a cliffhanger.

I'm engaged. I'm enjoying the show. I look forward to what's going to happen next. <br/><br/>My only hope: the writers develop themes in the midst of action; otherwise, DM (after awhile) will become just another space soap-opera, just another 'wait and let's see what's going to happen next' action drama without any lasting value. Let's all, together--writers and fans-- not let that happen; let's not let the world-building mean nothing; make it into a theme in itself, as it is in Firelfy (the world means what the situation is like--it speaks to the way of life and shifting norms). Let's not let the writers (or those directing the writers) think little of philosophic themes--e.g., existential agency over habitual norms; confronting cynical instinct when morality seemed the norm, etc.--as if these kinds of ideas can just float in the background and not come to fruition. There's so much potential here for good things that I can't help but have high hopes, and the technical skill of the production, set, and the ability of the actors to make things work--all this makes it easy to feel optimistic. My ranking of 9 is provisional and conditional but based on an 'educated guess.' Please, don't let this show turn into a mere workaday thing; let it find its transcendental niche!<br/><br/>Review UPDATE 1: After episode 6: that was the best episode yet--great sci-fi elements, bringing in material that allows for thematic exploration (existentialism vs. embodied memory determinism); characters having past experiences that they care about, from embodied memory, but that have their own new consciousnesses--there's heaps of potential here for thematic focus/representational value (understanding how to be a better human, what being human means, etc.) over Falling Skies soap opera one- episode-to-the-next formatting (which has its perks, to be sure, but can't stack up qualitatively to true works of art, which Dark Matter has the potential to offer).<br/><br/>After Episode 7: still holding strong. Sometimes I worry music is used too much to create a sense of cohesion between sequences, but at least I like the music.<br/><br/>UPDATE after season one: Dang, didn't see that coming! Mole revealed (and I was sad to find out who it was, though I'd be sad whoever it was, really, because each character has been developed sufficiently to care about their individuality). Cool to see Will on there, with beard; he's an old role model from growing up on STNG. Clearly he can act. Hope David Hewlett's character gets more integrated into things (he was my favorite character from Stargate Atlantis). <br/><br/>Well, what can I say? There's much that's set up for interesting thematic developments, come season two, and I think the writers have hinted at how those themes might gain clarity and depth. But I still can't measure thematics until they happen, in full, if they do. Most of the emphasis has been on world-building and mystery/identity development, and that's fine as long as it goes somewhere. It'll be a long wait to see if it does, but I look forward to getting into the mix of what's to come, and I can only hope future episodes give the philosophic problems introduced, in passing, the attention they deserve.<br/><br/>Will there be mini-webisodes from now until next season?", "rating": 9, "helpful": "112 out of 150 found this helpful.", "date": "3 July 2015"}, {"title": " SyFy did it again", "content": "What a shame.

The polygamy is not even close to what the show's all about-- even though that part is extremely interesting.<br/><br/>First off, Bill Paxton is charged with a tough duty-- he's really the backbone of the show, and he is flawless scene after scene after scene. The same can be said of Tripplehorn, Sevigny and Goodwin. Amanda Seyfriend also really shines in a quiet but emotionally conflicted role as the teenage daughter battling religious self-esteem and monogamy vs polygamy for a life path. Douglas Smith demonstrates great promise as a young actor whose character is in a state of constant awkwardness and whose introverted nature is taken to the backseat when a great personal challenge for him begins to arise in the second season.<br/><br/>The stories are fantastic, with wonderful characters at every level. Harry Dean Stanton as Roman Grant is an absolute masterclass in acting; his tiny, shriveled exterior does nothing to prevent us from fearing his powerful, commanding leadership role as the so-called prophet of the compound.<br/><br/>Boasting plot lines consistently intriguing and aiding in character development rather than mere shock value, it refuses to make overt caricatures out of characters easy to keep one-dimensional. For me personally as an atheist who is fascinated with the study of theology, it's rousing fun to cheer for the polygamist and his loving family.

I love the cast. Bill Paxton as \"Bill Hendrickson\" is the head of this crazy household and he makes you sympathize with him more than criticize him for the lifestyle he chose. His life is so stressful trying to run an expanding business, 3 households, appeasing 3 wives, hiding the fact that he is a polygamist from his neighbors and employees, dealing with the constant stress brought on by a man called the \"prophet\" who runs the polygamist compound Bill grew up in (his parents still live on this compound)who is trying to extort money out of his business and recently blocked it's expansion,and dealing with the stress that his brother and parents cause(i.e.his father played by Bruce Dern is a complete jerk and loves to pee in Bill's kitchen sink and his mother allegedly poisoned his father). I also love that he has a favorite wife,his 1st and only legal wife played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, because I love her character (she tries hard to be a good wife, mother, and support to the other wives) and the jealousy that the other wives feel make it that much more dramatic. His conniving 2nd wife played by Chloe Sevigny is so much fun to hate, not to mention she is the prophet's daughter and is loyal to him. And Gennifer Goodwin as his young 3rd wife is so cute and lovable. Though this show is chocked full of jealousy and emotion,you really get the sense that this family of 3 wives, 1 husband, and 7 children (with another 1 on the way)really do love each other. They're just having a hard time dealing with the stress that arises from this very unique lifestyle. Each week I wonder if the prophet is going to win his battle with Bill, if one of the wives are going to say forget it and leave, if this family is going to be exposed for what they are (a few characters have gotten close to discovering their secret), or if Bill is going to have a nervous break down. This show is jam packed with good actors and good acting with such interesting plots that you don't get caught up in feeling conflicted over liking this show because you think polygamy is wrong.

I really had little interest in watching a show about Mormons and polygamy in Utah, but I knew HBO would make it interesting. I love the cast! Bill Paxton is perfectly cast as the lead. He was always an underrated actor. Same goes with Jeanne Tripplehorn as his first (and favorite) wife. Chloe Sevigney is almost unrecognizable as the manipulative second wife, with her long hair and prairie outfits. I first noticed her in Kids. Newcomer Gennifer Goodwyn is quite good as the overwhelmed and lonely youngest third wife. She reminds me of a young Sherilyn Fenn. It doesn't hurt that all of the wives and eldest daughter are quite attractive!<br/><br/>One would think Bill's character would be envied, but the more we see into his everyday life, the more I say \"No thanks!\" Imagine dealing with three moody wives and children coming out of the woodwork! Everything has to be written in a daily planner, otherwise things get extremely chaotic. On top of dealing with his huge family, living in three adjacent houses with one back yard, he also has to run a growing chain of Home Depot-type stores, deal with the rest of his oddball family (parents and brother) still living on a polygamist compound run by an evil Harry Dean Stanton who keeps extorting money from Bill and harassing him and his family. Oh, and they also try to keep their polygamy secret from the nosy neighbors, and one of the wives has run up huge credit card debts! Plus almost everyone the family deals with is an over-religious meddler!

His first wife is really the typical Mormon wife and mom, very down to earth, modestly dressed but fashionable and very kind. His second wife, Nicki, is from the compound.

I served a LDS Mission and was married in the Salt Lake Temple. I lived in Utah from my infancy until I moved to the East Coast at age 27. The Church is absolutely integral to who I am. I love being a member and I try (with varying success) to follow its precepts.<br/><br/>After finishing the series, I was struck by the difference between how most people describe practicing members of the LDS Church (happy, friendly, hard-working, self-sufficient); and how they are portrayed here. I counted twenty characters in the show who are (or were) clearly LDS, and who had a sufficient role in the series to form an opinion on their character, and it's not positive: Na\u00efve (Heather), Nosy (Pam), Disillusioned (Scott), Homicidal (Carl), Intolerant (Cindi), Clintonian (Ray), Calculating (Sen. Dwyer), Blackmailing (Ted), Pedophilic (Greg), Vindictive (Wendy), Ostracizing (Nancy), Suicidal (Dale), Puritanical (Bishop Devery), Arrogant (Michael Sainte), Conniving (State Rep. Roy Colburn), Incompetent (Salty), Compromising (Emma Smith), Tyrannical (Stake President Kennedy), and Pushy (LDS Missionary Companionship).<br/><br/>Does the above accurately portray a representative sample of LDS members? Not really. Further, the LDS Church as an organization is consistently portrayed in the show as sinister and all-powerful. In one episode, Cara Lynn is scolded for walking home by herself because of the fear that a Church member would inflict physical harm. Nicki then refers to a letter regarding polygamy read in LDS Church Meetings as a \"fatwa.\" How nice. Little LDS digs like this abound throughout the series.<br/><br/>Olsen and Scheffer spent three years researching for the show before its creation. Given how unfavorably LDS members are portrayed, I often wondered if they had a specific grievance against the Church. I was unable to find any evidence of that, so my theory is simply that their intention was to create an entertaining television show; rather than an accurate picture of how real people in these situations would act and interact. As such, where reality and juicy storytelling conflict, they favor storytelling.<br/><br/>I hesitate to comment on other reviews of the show, but I was somewhat surprised at two common threads in the other reviews: (1) the number of reviews submitted in 2006 when the show was still in its infancy, and (2) the number of reviews that mentioned the quality of the writing. This made me wonder what people consider \"good writing.\" Is it \"good\" if it's interesting? Or compelling? Or complex? Or funny? \"Good\" by itself seems to be just specific enough to persuade people to watch, but just vague enough that it doesn't really have to mean anything at all.<br/><br/>I could list numerous inaccuracies portrayed as given truths in the series (major ones have been submitted as goofs on each episode's page), but suffice it to say that I was not particularly impressed by the writing. It may be because I was watching episodes of a weekly television show in rapid succession; but it seemed like the characters fell in and out of each other's favor with breakneck frequency. Nicky accrues tens of thousands in credit card debt? No problem\u2014wait an episode or two and it will blow over. Alby attempts to kill his mother with a pipe bomb at a motel? Don't worry\u2014she'll soon publicly protest his incarceration (for a different crime). Ben has premarital sex and wants to hold the Aaronic Priesthood? Sure\u2014we'll give him a pass. Frank and Lois try to kill each other? No sweat\u2014they'll make up soon. Dozens of story lines like this\u2014major, harrowing life events\u2014seem to resolve themselves effortlessly with no further mention or consequences. Additionally, I was mildly disappointed on several occasions when the writers seemed to go out of their way to dredge up old anti-Mormon canards such as Blood Atonement, Danites, and the number, age, and marital status of Joseph Smith's wives. Three years of research didn't necessarily seem to shine through in the show\u2014unless, perhaps, the three years was spent researching anti-Mormon material.<br/><br/>The series also explores the use of the word \"Mormon\" itself. Many people use it synonymously with \"LDS.\" Others use it for ANY organization or belief that accepts Joseph Smith as a prophet. Under this definition, the FLDS Church, the Community of Christ, the LDS Church, and numerous other smaller groups could accurately be called \"Mormon.\" I'm not advocating the correctness of any one definition, but I urge viewers of the show to keep in mind that \"Mormon\" doesn't always mean what people assume it means.<br/><br/>Some of the show's reviews asked why someone would ever practice plural marriage. While I don't (/wouldn't want to) practice it, it all boils down to a question of putting faith into action. When you commit to follow God's commandments no matter what, and when you believe that God still speaks through a prophet as he did in former times, the logical progression of this syllogism (for us) is that you do what the prophet says, even if it is inconvenient, or expensive, or tiring, or (in extremely rare cases) illegal. THAT is the logic behind the practice of plural marriage. Clearly, it can (and does) get twisted by some who prey on the faithful, but that was never the purpose. Similarly, if you can you think of something you value in your life above upholding the law, something that you consider moral and necessary that you would do even if it were illegal, you can now begin to understand their mentality.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, my main purpose here is NOT to steer anyone away from the show. I heartily enjoyed the series. It's extremely entertaining. I would simply request of anyone who watches, however, to please remember that this is fiction, and that the majority of what you see is a heavily distorted caricature of deeply held beliefs and sincere people who are trying to follow Jesus Christ and help their fellow man.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "9 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "29 March 2013"}, {"title": " Just to clarify", "content": "I just wanted to clarify some incorrect information that omgwtflolbbq from washington, DC stated in his comment about the show.

Hinckley stated, \"\"This Church has nothing whatever to do with those practicing polygamy. They are not members of this Church. . . .

Not only are those so involved in direct violation of the civil law, they are in violation of the law of this Church.\" HBO placed a disclaimer on the first episode of \"Big Love,\" stating the LDS Church's position, and I believe the show's creators say they have taken pains to separate Latter-day Saints from polygamists.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "13 out of 27 found this helpful.", "date": "12 April 2007"}, {"title": " A show about the biggest bunch of screw ups you'll ever meet", "content": "This show suffers from the most fundamental flaw imaginable -- not a single main character is worth caring about. Why? Because their flaws range from pure evil to raging arrogance, lying, lust, greed, jealousy, pettiness, delusional thinking, hypocrisy, and sheer, utter stupidity. I'm not kidding. These characters lack even the most basic fundamental human qualities. The men are misogynist, and the women are portrayed in a variety of negative lights -- take your pick.<br/><br/>There are two main groups. The first group consists of a suburbanite polygamous husband and his 3 wives and 7 children who are self-styled adherents to an outlawed variation of Mormonism called Fundamental Latter Day Saint (FLDS), many of whom have broken away from \"the compound\", an even more extreme version/full-on polygamous community which constitutes the second group.<br/><br/>The head of the FLDS household is Bill, a former member of the compound who was exiled when he was 14 years old (supposedly a common practice to eliminate younger males, leaving more teenage female brides for the older pedophile leader types). He's the \"American Dream\" come true. He's built up a prosperous home improvement business in the Utah suburbs, where he lives with his three wives (Barb, Nicki, and Margene) and 7 children. (NOTE: Bill's solution to the impotence that is confounding his ability to have continual sex with his 3 wives (they have a schedule) is: Viagra.)<br/><br/>To make a long story short, his first wife Barb is a cancer survivor. They have 3 children. While Barb was going through cancer treatment Bill had a \"revelation\" that he was supposed to start practicing \"The Principle\" (the doctrine that some select men are told by G-d that they should take on more wives in a holy mission to get to heaven). So he married Nicki, the daughter of Roman Grant, the self-proclaimed prophet and leader of the compound group, and she bore him two children. Then later on Bill met Margene, a young waitress with whom he fathered two children.<br/><br/>In the process of attempting to expand his one home improvement store, Bill finagles a way to eliminate the 15% due his father-in-law, Roman Grant. (Since Roman fronted Bill the money for the first store for an agreed-upon 15% of the profits, he (Roman) believes he is legally entitled to 15% of the profits from the second store as well. Bill disagrees. Thus begins \"The Dysfunctional Family Feud\" in earnest.) <br/><br/>Tangentially, since polygamy is illegal, everyone in the suburban clan lies -- to neighbors, co-workers, classmates, etc. As indicated above, all the business dealings are sketchy at best, and situational ethics is putting it mildly when it comes to how this group lives their lives.<br/><br/>As far as the compound group goes...one nut case runs around poisoning those she dislikes. Another nut case (Bill's father) goes around peeing in the sink instead of the bathroom. Bill's mother and Bill's father are at odds and can't be in the same room together. And on...and on...and on.<br/><br/>If there are people in this world who are more lost than these miscreants, I'd sure hate to meet them. They seem to have NO IDEA what they are doing, or why. They claim to be spiritual, yet they constantly obsess about money, each other, and their rivals/enemies. There isn't a single healthy relationship in the bunch -- especially at the compound. (That place is such a total mess it's impossible to even get into it here. One lurid example: Roman Grant can \"reassign\" any woman/wife to another man whenever he feels like it.) Everyone is constantly lying to one another and cheating on each other and basically just making a total mess out of their lives and the lives of their children.<br/><br/>In short...if you have a lot of patience for stupid, shallow, pompous hypocrites who have no insight into their own behaviors and/or motivations, then this is the show for you. Otherwise, do yourselves a Big Favor and pass on Big Love. The acting is amateurish (Ginnifer Goodwin really SHOULD quit her day job; she's a train wreck in everything she's ever done. And Bill Paxton isn't much better. Heck...even Chloe Sevigny, who I like a lot, is totally wasted here.) The dialogs range from witty and funny to just plain ridiculous.

I know that's part of the point - part of the dynamic of the show, but still. One thing I don't get and I don't think is adequately explained is why would someone want more than one wife. The financial and other burdens are enormous, as the show illustrates. There are allusions to religious reasons, but that's about as far as it goes.<br/><br/>What is the upside? What would compel someone to do this? What is the motivation? What is the motivation for these women to enter into such an arrangement? These things go largely unexplored.

Nothing could stop her or this telenovela - not lousy video quality, not soap opera-like directing, not even bad secondary actors. Nothing. It was that good. Season 2 unfortunately falls short. I can see why Kate de Castillo was so reluctant to return the the series.<br/><br/>In season 2 I see a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles. While video and filming is more atmospheric and sets are much more lavish, they don't make up for the shortcomings. Suddenly, Epifanio Vargas is surrounded by political advisors who appear to be Mexico's WASPy blue bloods - the ones that look like they drink gin and tonics and wouldn't look out of place summering at a Kennedy mansion in Massachusetts. Por que? Epifanio is a drug lord. He would be as comfortable with these upper crust snobs as El Chapo and just as contemptuous.<br/><br/>I am also seeing tiresome old tropes from American television. Namely, the scene where one of Aljarafe's granddaughters, Paloma, is hiding from a psychopathic boyfriend. For some reason the predation and sexual victimization of women is a popular theme that shows up in every other American drama. I find it really offensive and it was the reason why I started watching La Reina del Sur in the first place - to get away from directors who pass off the cruel sexual victimization of women as \"entertainment\". Hollywood does not depict children or men being sexually assaulted anywhere nearly as often - most likely because it's too horrible for the audience to watch. So why is the brutal victimization of women so much fun to watch? It's pure misogyny. Do the producers even know their telenovela fanbase (hint: it's not macho middle-aged men that enjoy watching women being victimized). I skipped the Game of Thrones series on HBO after reading several chapters of the first novel.<br/><br/>I re-started my Netflix account specifically to watch La Reina. If all Netflix wants to do is show women being hunted like animals - a female victimization formula much beloved by American directors and producers, I am quitting La Reina. Sexual victimization is unbelievably horrific and cruel to women just as it is to men and children. Telemundo needs to realize that season 1 rose to fame because they did something special - and it wasn't just creating an anti-hero. It worked because the audience got to see a female underdog develop sharp teeth and bite back. Teresa Mendoza transforms from a small-time female money changer to a powerful drug lord who calls the shots. This is the winning theme. Women don't want to watch other women being horribly, violently, sexually assaulted. It is not \"entertainment\" for us.<br/><br/>Telemundo needs to stop listening to Netflix. They won the jackpot with the original La Reina NOT Netflix. Take back the reins and hand it back to the original directors, writers, and producers. Just re-create what they did in season 1. Don't let Netflix, a big budget, a lack of imagination, and canned, old, repetitive, tiresome Hollywood film conventions ruin what was a wonderful series. It's obvious that with the rise in popularity of K-dramas that Hollywood no longer knows what viewing audiences want.

I think that it's adorable. But after watching this show, I am greatly disappointed.<br/><br/>1. First of all, the characters are unlikable. They overreact with everything. The main character, Riley, is too awkward and needs to relax. I get that her character is supposed to be that way, but she is overdoing it, which makes it really cringe-worthy. Her way of acting is unbelievable.<br/><br/>2. The acting is either very poor, or it is just bad written. They need to be more mature. I get it that they start out as seventh graders, but students even that age doesn't act the way they do. Friends don't necessarily sit with each other and say, \"I'm glad that we're friends.\" or \"Do you promise to stay with me forever?\" Well, it may seem believable in some way, but they overreact saying it. They don't need to cry every time they say something meaningful. Yes, people have feelings and they probably truly love each other and they don't want to have their friendship die. I get that, but it gives me cringes whenever I watch those moments. Correct me if I'm wrong, but people don't usually sit around with each other talking like that.<br/><br/>3. Cory and Topanga don't really seem like parents. I mean, I love them in BMW. It was one of my favorite Disney Channel shows. But in this show...they are just too much. Instead of taking charge, they whine to each other if their children are doing something wrong or if they are \"growing up.\" Parents do get upset when their children start growing up, but they act unrealistically towards their children. <br/><br/>4.Cory is Riley's history teacher. Yeah. Well, as far as I know if a parent is a teacher, their child is not allowed to be in their class due to advantages. In class, Cory only calls on Riley, Maya, Farkle, Lucas, and Zay. Sometimes he calls on Yogi, Sabrina Carpenter's sister or that other blonde girl (sorry I can't stand this show so I don't watch it much). If I were in that class, I'd get upset that I'd never be able to do anything that the main characters get to do. For example, in one episode, Riley, Maya, Farkle, and Lucas have to sell muffins. Riley and Farkle are on a team, and Maya and Lucas are on another. They are the only ones who are able to sell muffins, while the rest have to stick to being customers. I know this is a show and they need all the attention, but seriously. At least call on others so it can seem more realistic. They get to call out random things any time they want and Cory accepts it. Cory is a great lesson teacher, but he never actually teaches them stuff they need to know for their education. In the high school episodes, Smackle is in all of them, but it still doesn't make a difference.<br/><br/>5. Lucas looks way older than the character he acts on. In fact, he is. Peyton Meyer, the actor of Lucas, is seventeen. So is Sabrina Carpenter (Maya), but she somewhat looks the part.<br/><br/>Overall, this show is unbelievably awful and is a terrible spin-off.

The first 2 seasons show the kids in middle school and are a bit easier to understand the state of the show, however once they reach midway through season 2 it goes downhill rather fast.<br/><br/>The first seasons are a kid's/family show that show two girls and their friends going through middle school. These are enjoyable until the show kind of tries to hard basically. At the halfway point of season 2, the show tries to replicate BMW, but without any sense of realism. Playing up love triangles as a common and/or ok thing, while trying to portray the characters as growing and helping develop them. The show simply struggles to evolve with the obvious physical growth of the characters.. This boring, borderline innapropriate/unneccesary story arch continues into season 3, which sees them go to high school...<br/><br/>Immediately you can tell this is going to be the worst season yet.. The kids seem like middle schoolers in high school. They try to up the drama, and it honestly is basically the same thing as season 1, the only true character evolution is Farkle, and that is mainly superficial and on the surface and maybe a bit less ADHD. Lucas is boring as ever and simply doesn't have much acting range at all... Maya is trying WAY too hard to be Shawn without any of the appeal the original character had.. Zay and Smackle are just kind of there.. While Riley is still the same uber-optimistic girl she always has been, but without maturing despite being portrayed in stories that clearly want to be portrayed as such..<br/><br/>The show simply never matured.. The stories were super light, and almost nothing strikes home as the original show did. They force relationships without any semblance of chemistry or reasoning. This show is enjoyable as long as you don't expect anything beyond a typical disney kids show from this era, it just really falls flat in terms of life lessons and doesn't seem the slightest bit realistic and is constantly over or underacted..<br/><br/>The positives however are there, which makes it somewhat watchable.. Though the stories are cringey, Riley is very lovable and is a good leader with her constant and almost exhausting optimism. her relationship with Maya may dwindle as the seasons go on and they almost become the same kind of person, but it is still similar to the Shawn/Cory relationship. The cameos are good, but sadly not great and never take any emphasis over anything. Unlike the original show it is ALWAYS about Riley or Maya, without much flowing plot or subplots.<br/><br/>The original characters Topanga and Cory are okay, but pretty unbelievable as parents. Cory is probably the best written character and has basically become a mixture of Mr Turner and Mr Feeny, but sometimes comes of very corny.. Topanga is just too inconsistent and sometimes is stern and other times goofy. She is referred to as smart, but never shows it as in the original show. Shawn is just barely there, which is a shame as when he shows up the episodes are better, same with Eric.<br/><br/>I know this dragged a bit, but I really wanted to enjoy this show fully, and though it is OKAY, it is not even what i would call good or great, especially if you are expecting something like the original show, it simply is too vanilla and lacks the hard hitting stories and characters that made the original a show you could connect with.<br/><br/>Show it to your kids, at least the first few seasons, and talk with them about the lessons within, but don't expect too much family enjoyment, as it simply isn't a well rounded show with stuff for everyone, it is sadly more limited.<br/><br/>As a BMW fan I'd give it a 2/10\nAs a non-BMW fan knowing nothing of it, i'd give it a 6/10 compared to other Disney shows these days.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, give it a try", "rating": 4, "helpful": "5 out of 5 found this helpful.", "date": "26 November 2019"}, {"title": " New and Nostalgic at the same time", "content": "I grew up on Boy Meets World.

Cory and Topanga from Boy Meets World are around too, helping the girls with their problems. One of the best parts of the show (and there's not a lot) is Cory and Topanga, along with the other returning BMW veterans. It's so great to see them again, and they all feel like the same characters we knew and loved in the 90s. So, it's a shame we don't get to spend more time with them. Instead, we're forced to deal with the children. Riley Matthews is the main character of this mess and also the daughter of Cory and Topanga. I'm sorry, but she's the worst character on this thing. She's extremely annoying and there's just something off about her. Rowan Blanchard is an absolutely terrible actress. She tries way too hard and has awful line delivery. That's not what you'd generally want from a lead actress. Maya Hart, her best friend, is actually a pretty good character. Maya's story arcs are some of the most mature on the show which really give her depth. Sabrina Carpenter is a great actress and I just know she's going to move on to bigger and better things. Then there's Farkle. He's a creep and there's no point to him. We also have Lucas. Riley likes Lucas even though Lucas is the flattest, most boring character on the show. There's nothing that anybody could realistically see in him. Auggie is the little brother character just there for comic relief and subplots. <br/><br/>This show also tries way too hard to be deep and meaningful, but it just doesn't work.

Once I saw that it was a Disney show, I became hesitant, but still entered with an open mind. The first thing you notice is the return of Topanga and Cory Matthews. And that's essentially the only good part of the show. The problem with GMW is mainly that started on Disney, which meant the show had to start with bad actors, bad plot, horrible scripts and cheesy morals. Even Danielle Fishel and Ben Savage (Topanga and Cory) who were great actors in the original show, have become silhouettes of those original characters, with extreme overacting and characters that simply aren't believable. Now, onto the main characters; First, there's the MAIN character and daughter of Cory and Topanga, Riley. To be blunt, she is a horrible character and actor. She seems to have no experience and is another shining example of over acting. The charm of Cory from BMW was that he was a good seed who often got in to trouble, and the lessons came from that. The problem with Riley is that her character is a \"Beacon Of Perfection\". There is never any trouble to be had for her, which means all of the morals have to come from other, rather unimportant things. Like the intense conundrum of \"Are we dating?\". One thing that comes with the GMW's Disney logo, is the restraint of serious topics. Such as in the original BMW, the episode \"Wake Up, Little Cory\" which focused on the kids ideas of sex and love. When events transpire and people think Cory slept with Topanga, the real lessons come out. Whereas, because GMW is featured on Disney, this show will never see anything even close to those topics, which really restrains the show. Now, back to the characters. Riley's best friend, Maya is probably the best character on the show. She is there to fulfill the role of Shaun from BMW, but she is nowhere near the same levels of depth that Shaun had. Maya is the most mature character on the show, but she still doesn't go around blowing things up with Cherry Bombs or going on strike in school like Shaun did. She's still a pretty clean character. Then, there's Farkle. He really serves no purpose. He's not the super smart outcast like his father Stuart used to be. He's actually a relatively creepy character. He's constantly taking hits at his female friends, trying to get a date out of them. And I mean constantly. He's just weird. And then we have Lucas, Riley's crush and one of the worst characters on the show. He's flat, shows no emotion ever, definitely can't act and is only there to be the crush/boyfriend character. The only characters that are actually important are Riley and Maya, and you don't even care for them. Whereas, in BMW, you cared for pretty much everyone in Cory's \"group\". <br/><br/>Anyways, in review, GMW tries to live up to it's predecessor, but it falls very short. If it lost most of it's actors (except Danielle and Ben) and moved to a better channel, like ABC, this show could actually be something.

I think the actress playing Riley has the right amount of preteen curiosity and awkwardness as well as the ability to deliver humor.

However, it's a kids show, so adult viewers need to remember that kids don't pick up on repetitive elements as easily. <br/><br/>For those worried about it being too \"Disney\", all I have to say is that after watching part of the \"Disney Channel Original Movie\" that was on before the pilot, this show is MUCH better than typical Disney shows.

To my dismay, this show is nothing like BMW. It is laced with the same immature comedy, shallow emotions, poor attempts at touching moments, and un-relatable characters of most other Disney shows of this generation. Riley (Rowan Blanchard) is portrayed as the over- exaggerated, bland, and obnoxious daughter of Corey and Topanga. She lacks any depth as a character - nothing like Corey's character in BMW. She is not likable at all. Her best friend Maya (Sabrina Carpenter) is the \"Shawn\" of the show, and is a little bit better but still lacks any real character depth or development. Girl Meets World attempts to steal similar story arcs from BMW, but fails at them miserably - the girl who is \"coming of age\" and learning about life, with the \"troubled\" best friend who needs guidance because her parents border on neglect; the teacher who is more than a teacher, but who becomes more involved in the students' lives and teaches (or attempts to teach) real life lessons. This would have been okay, if the writers had done a better job of recreating these arcs. But Maya's story is nothing like Shawn's in terms of believe-ability and demonstrates none of the real emotional turmoil that accompanies these situations, something which was portrayed flawlessly in BMW. I could go on and on about what BMW had that GMW attempts to have but falls short. Even the most frivolous and comedic episodes of BMW contained more depth and truly touching moments that the watcher felt to their core, than the most mature and serious episodes of GMW. Overall, GMW attempts to be the BMW of the generation, but ends up feeling shallow, rushed, and immature. <br/><br/>The only thing that salvaged the show - and is the reason for my 5 star rating - is the return of some of the original cast. While I'm overall disappointed with Topanga's sidekick, background role, she still is a delight to see again in the company of Corey. Both of them steal every scene they are in.

Not only that... but Corey is being talked down to constantly by his own wife and daughter multiple times... I felt so bad for Ben Savage as an Actor. Speaking of Actors... Ben as Corey... did Amazing! Ryder as Shawn... Excellent! William as Eric... Wonderful! And who can forget... FEENAY! Absolutely Legendary! Danielle did a great job I will admit... but I can't say that her character in this MISTAKE of a show did any good. There are life lessons sure... but A LOT are NOT realistic solutions in the real world, and I feel so bad for this year's generation of kids watching this show.

Boy Meets World was good, but this spin off is not done well. The lead, Rowan Blanchard, is visibly very nervous, and tries to hard to make her character different from Ben Savages' character, Cory. Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel are back and still the same, but with a hint of absolute CHEESINESS!! The show is very cheesy and seems like it only will MAYBE entertain an 8 year old. The show does not target the Disney pre-teen, teen audience, even though the characters are supposed to be around that age. The only standout of this show is Sabrina Carpenter, who overshadows Blanchard by basically saying everything for her like a ventriloquist. Carpenter delivers a very real, and raw performance as her troubled character Maya. The only thing Boy Meets World fans will be happy about is the endless cameos and appearances of the original cast.

I soon realised that this was something special; the colours are all brighter than normal, the dialogue is more wordy than people really use and the plot is surreal to say the least. All these things could have lead to a disaster but it worked perfectly for me. The cast did a great job bringing their surreal world to life.<br/><br/>Ned isn't like ordinary people; he can bring the dead back to life with a single touch, there are two major catches though, if he touches that person a second time they will die forever and if he leaves a person alive for more than a minute somebody else nearby must die. Using this skill he is able to help private detective Emerson Cod by questioning murder victims. Things change for Ned when one of the victims he revives is his childhood sweetheart Charlotte \"Chuck\" Charles. He can't bring himself to touch her again which apart from causing somebody else's death leads to a very difficult relationship between them. When Ned isn't dealing with dead people he cooks in The Pie Hole, the pie-restaurant he owns.<br/><br/>Most of the episodes are of the murder-of-the-week variety although there are some continuing threads to the story. The murders are never anything normal; their strangeness reminded me of the 1960s series \"The Avengers\". As well as having two great leading characters the supporting cast does a great job, I especially liked Kristin Chenoweth's portrayal of the diminutive Olive Snook a Pie Hole employee with a soft spot for Ned but who does not know his strange secret.<br/><br/>It is a shame that the series was cut short but I'm glad that it was given a proper ending even if there were a few loose ends left untied the main story had nice conclusion.

Realistic, on this show ? Pushing Daisies is, truly, pure and utter escapism. It's colour palette, the dialogue used, the scenarios, situations, music: all of it, to me, is just an escape from everyday life. An escape from the mundane and boring. It is here where Pushing Daisies exceeds exceptionally well Pushing Daisies isn't for everyone: A large majority of the television audience don't \"get\" it, for some people it's just too out there and silly. But for people like me, even from the first episode I watched of it (Season 2's \"Frescorts\") and I was just blown away by the show. From then on, I bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my DVD player.

Completing the main cast members are aunts Lily and Vivian, whom Charlotte (Chuck) is never allowed to see. They live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life, everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour, and narrated by Jim Dale.<br/><br/>Other than outlining the basics of the show, I really can't praise it much more without saying: Just watch it.

Whether it is creative or just pretentious, for a lot of people (me included) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing, and I hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so I'm not left with just 22, 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "87 out of 113 found this helpful.", "date": "22 July 2009"}, {"title": " Another one bites the dust", "content": "After 10 plus years I still miss this show.

It had its absurdest elements but they were offset by a realistic production design; which kept it grounded. The strength of \"Dead Like Me\" was its foundation of normalcy, despite the supernatural elements the characters behaved in ways that viewers instantly identified with. \"Pushing Daisies\" is more like \"Austin Powers\", you might find it funny at times but there is never a strong connection with the characters.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know?

The fact that this was supposed to be a horror series made it even more appealing to me.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is like a bad version of The Vampire Diaries. This series had potential to be really good but is just terribly written. The dialogue was absolutely awful. There are so many forced one liners thrown in and the way the two main characters say \"shiiiiit\" in almost every episode is just terrible.<br/><br/>****Warning Spoilers**** They also don't do a very good job of explaining anything in the series. The first couple episodes I was wondering if werewolves were normal in this world, then later you find out that they're not normal and no one believes in them but for some reason this town is willing to blame the murders on some kid that some other kid said was a werewolf. I was like WTF, terrible terrible storytelling. <br/><br/>And the f***ing bacon grease scene, WTF was that. When I saw it I couldn't believe they actually put that in the episode. It could have been so much better. They find out who the killer is and she confesses what she did and says she wants to die as long as he doesn't hate her. All he has to do is cut off her head. Instead the writers are like let's see how stupid of a scene we can actually get them to put in this series. Let's imply that he has to fight her as a werewolf and that he has to sacrifice his face and needs bacon grease to turn when it's not a full moon. Then instead of cutting off her head, he's going to let her turn and rub bacon grease on his face, then she's going to eat his face off and attack his best friend and girlfriend and almost kill them. Then finally he's going to turn and she's going to kill him anyway. So F***ing terrible, F***ing bacon grease. Seriously if you want to see how terrible the show is, just watch the first 10 minutes or so of episode 13.<br/><br/>****End Spoilers****<br/><br/>I watched the whole season hoping it would get better but it only got worse. The actors did an OK job with what they had to work with, but overall they didn't help make the series any better. The finale, which in my opinion is usually the best episode of a season and should be, was absolutely terrible. It had one good scene that made me think, finally they did something right.<br/><br/>Bottom line if you can get past the terrible dialogue and forced one liners you might be able to enjoy it a little, but there are much better things to watch.

The voice acting is very strong. And, despite lofty and complex narratives, it is centered on the human condition and family relationships, so it is immediately relatable. If you like psychological sci fi, this is a captivating watch, though MANIAC on Netflix is very similar in its themes and is FAR superior for reasons I describe later, mostly due to MANIACs superior script that isnt smug or expository or reliant on animations for insterest and nearly every character has a meaningful arc.<br/><br/>Also, the animation is interesting and allows the special effects to blend easily and look real while allowing the animators to enhance any weaknesses in the physical performances of the actors or sets.<br/><br/>Undone isnt without its faults. It constantly and insesently virtue signals by Howard Zinning america, westernism, and americans with completely needless zingers that have nothing to do with the plot (except to make the lead even more dislikeable, I suppose) while shoe-horning romanticized anecdotes and spirituality of any other culture except american culture. This often tears you right out of the story and makes the story seem like a thin cracker on which to deliver a pate of smug angry propoganda. Why does EVERYTHING have to be some kind of woke, these days? And, if so, can't the story come first and only then maybe you can slide in your nonsequitor jab at America if you really need to get it out there?<br/><br/>But, that wouldnt be the so bad except that the lead character is extremely selfish, annoying, rude, wholly unlikable, and she encourages the same from those around her. Yet, she is given amazing powers that she absolutely doesnt deserve and then ::spoilers:: we find out her dad is a bad guy, too. There is nothing to like about the lead characters in this show at all. The mom is overbearing, the dad is a jerk, and the daughter is even worse.<br/><br/>And, then, they make the sister awful, too, by marrying a man ::spoilers:: who she doesnt love who she cheats on repeatedly in a pattern because (though this isnt stated as a bad thing, just a sarcastic joke) she was raised by a single mom and never had a solid male role model. Yet, the story doesnt dwell on this aspect or treat it much as a negative, but instead, celebrates these multiple lies as though they are somewhat meaningless and empowering for her as a woman.<br/><br/>But, it is the ending of this that is ultimately unfulfilling and badly written. I wont spoil it all here, but it is completely unsatisfying and weak and the time traveling aspect from any point of view doesnt even try to make any kind of sense.<br/><br/>I really began to like this somewhere after the first episode and then got more annoyed by the final half and especially the end.

They rarely had big surprises or twists, and the plot of one episode rarely carried over into future episodes. However, the stories were (for the most part) well written, intelligent, and often unique. For example, in the sixth season's \"Draw Me a Killer\", a young man \"in love\" with a female comic book character murders people who resemble her fictional adversaries. This sort of creativity resulted in interesting plots that didn't have to depend upon shocks or gimmicks to be watchable.<br/><br/>Hawaii Five-O was authentic. It was shot entirely on location in Hawaii. Most took place in Honolulu, but the show saw some time on the other islands, as well. Local actors were used to fill nearly every minor part in almost all episodes. While many of these actors were clearly amateurs, you didn't care. This actually added to the show's charm and authenticity. Some of these locals had recurring parts, being seen in different roles in as many as 14 episodes. That also wasn't a big deal, provided you didn't take the show too seriously.<br/><br/>Hawaii Five-O was nice to look at. The show went out of its way to create scenes with beautiful backdrops, allowing the viewer to feel he's on a Hawaiian vacation while in his own living room.<br/><br/>Hawaii Five-O featured one of the best opening theme songs and title sequences. It still holds up well 37 years later. Even the end title sequence, showcasing about 20 native Hawaiians paddling a boat through the ocean off Hawaii, fit in with the show's Hawaiian authenticity. A bit of trivia regarding the opening sequence: The famous wave at the beginning was NOT filmed for Hawaii Five-O, and was instead taken from some 1962 stock footage. This footage was so unimportant at the time that it is now unknown exactly where that wave video originated. Also, the 10-year-old boy shown on the beach was randomly selected and given $5 for allowing himself to be filmed. He didn't know he was in the opening titles until kids at school teased him about it! The first 7 seasons of the show were by far superior to the final 5. The show especially deteriorated by season 11. This was simply a case of a show that had run its course, and it honestly should have been canceled two years earlier.<br/><br/>Jack Lord did a superb job as Five-O head Steve McGarrett. We never got to learn too much about the lives of the other characters, but it was always clear that they were there to support McGarrett. The unity and dedication amongst the characters of the show was comforting to watch. While many cop shows (such as NYPD Blue) introduce conflict between the main characters, this had no place in Hawaii Five-O. This was a show about Five-O versus the criminal element of Hawaii.<br/><br/>Despite the repeated showcasing of Honolulu's crime, Hawaii Five-O actually did a lot to boost Hawaii tourism.

One of the primary reasons for the show's success can be attributed to Jack Lord's inimitable portrayal of tough no nonsense cop Steve McGarrett. From its inception in the 1968 pilot movie 'cocoon', McGarrett pitted wits with villain 'Wo Fat' and continued to do so on numerous occasions until the series ended in 1980. Other regulars included James MacArthur as Danny 'Danno' Williams (1968-1979) and Chin Ho Kelly played by Kam Fong (1968-1979) The show exuded coolness in every frame shot, the opening title sequence today looks as fresh and as exciting as it ever did - thirty years on! Morton Stevens' pulsating theme tune without doubt is one of the most vibrant pieces of music to ever accompany a television series. In short, the show is pure escapism that has never and may never be rivalled again. Notable episodes are:  Over Fifty? Steal (episode #59); No Bottles.....No Cans......No People (episode #74); and the Vashon trilogy from season 5 (episodes #105, #106 and #107).", "rating": 10, "helpful": "23 out of 25 found this helpful.", "date": "14 March 2000"}, {"title": " the grandaddy of them all!!!!!", "content": "Th e1970's was often called the age of tv cop shows.

I am going to tell you something about Jack Lord that is not generally well known, I learned this from one of Paul Harvey's \"The Rest Of The Stories\". Although his role as the hard hitting cop would suggest he was anything but sensitive, Jack Lord was really a very different man in real life. He was an artist and a very sucessful one as well and it wasn't because he was a tv star. Five of his paintings are in the famous Metropolitan Musuem of Art in New York City. People have paid fortunes for them! As a student Lord won numerous awards for his art and people have paid fortunes for even his simplist watercolors. Lord often quoted Sean O'Casey and said \"Let us find a way to spin joy into every moment of tomorrow's day\". As Steve McGarret Lord was almost like a modern day knight. All the tv cop shows since in a way owe their sucess to him.

The remainder of the team was cast with varying results, with both James McArther as Danno, and Kam Fong as Chin Ho Kelly being excellent in their roles. Even the mediocre Zulu as Kono would share the occasional \"Hey brot'r\". I personally feel that the long-time nemesis Wo Fat, played to the hilt by Khigh Dhiegh, is one of the best bad guys of all time TV. The running clash between McGarrett and Wo Fat always made Steve's life interesting. My favorite episode is the light and comical, \"Over Fifty? Steal!\" starring Hume Cronyn as Lewis Filer. Also exceptional was the 3 episode block, \"V for Vashon\" starring Harold Gould. This is one TV series that I will definitely be purchasing if it is ever available in the DVD format. For my money, I place my Top 3 all-time TV series as: 1) X-Files; 2) Hawaii Five-0; and 3) The Dick Van Dyke Show.

Law and Magnum P.I. in the 80's. The trend continues with today's \"Law and Order\" and \"CSI\". Jack Lord stars as the tough, no-nonsense, overly analytical, intelligent and charismatic Steve McGarret, who for years solves crimes and puts baddies behind bars in the beautiful state-island of Hawaii. James McArthur portrayed his right hand man Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams and Asian actor Kam Fong portrayed Chin-Ho, another resourceful detective on the police force. Shot on location in Honolulu, Hawaii and other parts of the islands, the series was ahead of its time. A lot of the episodes (though not all of them) seem very real and probable, as if the crimes being committed, as dramatic as they were, could actually occur. For instance, several crimes involved drug traffic and prostitution, which never stops even in the mainland of the US. Admittedly, some of the villains were fiendishly evil, bordering on comic book villains, especially in the more psychotic criminals who killed for sport or fetishes. When the baddies weren't after peoples' lives, they were out to get their money in elaborate money schemes. At times, the show was full of contrived suspense, i.e. they would leave out enough in a span of ten minutes to leave you hanging before commercial breaks. Some episodes were divided into two parts, particularly the overly dramatic ones i.e. McGarett gets shot, they have to find out who shot him, he is hospitalized and during that time Dano takes over, McGarett is sued and goes to court, etc. Several villains returned various times to the show. The writing on the show is well-done and there was an overall feeling of mystery and action, though never as violent as today's shows.

It had a lot a factors going for it : Spectacular opening and closing credit sequences, a grabber of a theme song, exotic locations, a charismatic lead actor who had great hair and knew how to work it, and a racially diverse and intriguing supporting cast.<br/><br/>The series creator took a chance and had Jack Lord play McGarrett as a hard-nosed, hard-driving tough guy instead of a \"Teddy bear\" type, but this worked because McGarrett was so obviously committed to his job and to \"Law And Order\" that his brilliance and energy won the audience over, and in fact made them like him even more than if he had been played as a \"Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes\" character.<br/><br/>But the thing that sets Five O apart in my mind, is that whoever was in charge of story and script quality really knew their stuff and were allowed to do their job. H50 episodes had remarkably tight and internally consistent plots and screenplays. The screenplays always played fair with the audience, and almost always featured extremely clever plot devices, gimmicks or MacGuffins that made you admire the deviousness and ingenuity of the characters who were trying to do bad things under Five-O's watchful eye. And McGarett and his staff would scramble against a deadline to understand the gimmick and solve the mystery or the heist or the caper before the 'bad guys' could get away with whatever they were planning. And each episode was directed and edited with crispness and energy that kept everything moving and wasted no screen time.<br/><br/>Many times things were so interesting that the hour long show seemed to be over almost as soon as it started.

Its locale, its central character, and much else have been copied since. From beginning to end of its dozen-years' run, this was a quality production. It began as a TV movie; and from first to last Jack Lord played the head of this special investigation unit, Steve McGarrett. He reported directly to the Attorney General and Governor of the state; and his unit took on murder and all the other most difficult cases.

The cast included besides Richard Denning as the Governor and several other regulars McGarrett's unit, comprised of James MacArthur as young Danny Williams, Zulu as Kono Kalakaua, Kam Fong as Chin Ho Kelly and Harry Endo as lab man Che Fong for seven years. As regulars left the series, others were hired including Al Harrington, Herman Wedemeyer, and later in the series Sharon Farrell.

The show's theme, its locations, Jack Lord's saying, \"Book 'em Danno--murder one\" became household icons. Finally the series ran out of new cast members and new crimes worthy of an hour's length of narrative film. But the ethical quality of its tough-minded lead, the clear, crisp photography and the swift-paced and intelligent dialogue read in authentic locales set a new standard in each case for what had until 1968 been a rather insular TV production system, shot mostly in Los Angles regardless of the storyline.

Being a man, I rarely care much for romance in movies and TV per say but the great on screen chemistry between Jane Seymour and Joe Lando was awesome and really made this show even better. Also the evolution of some of the townspeople character going from pure racists to acceptance of other races through the series 6 year run also gave such great credibility to the show and like i said before many many of the shows really pulled at my heartstrings while others were very funny,,,,I was very impressed with the actors portraying the townspeople and hands up to Jason Leland Adams who is a great actor playing Custer in the season 2 and 3 and joining the cast as banker Preston Lodge III seasons 4-6 (any actor that can make u despise the character they are portraying is a great actor),,superb show well worth buying the entire series,,watching the shows from the pilot through 6 seasons and the final 2 movies made all the difference in the world in coming to appreciate the highest quality of the writing, acting and explosive issues this show tackled (rape, murder, death, cancer, discrimination of race and gender, etc. etc. ,many of which are still major issues in todays time. I also appreciated the medical issues regarding diagnosis, medical equipment and medicines used in the 1860's,,,very authentic show specializing in the crucial importance of family values,,a show for all families as my whole family has benefited from watching these DVD's over and over, I have watched the entire series within 6 weeks of purchasing it and now have started rewatching and its nice how i can catch things i previously missed during my watching the series the first time.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "20 out of 23 found this helpful.", "date": "6 January 2012"}, {"title": " Engaging Western series portrays frontier town's lady doctor", "content": "While I was not a faithful devotee of the series, I tuned in whenever the opportunity presented itself and invariably enjoyed the stories revolving around a frontier town's lady doctor. I view the program strictly as entertainment, and missed too many episodes to comment accurately on any social issues depicted or historical liberties taken. However, I will note that the show does justifiably denounce racism and tends to cast native people in a sympathetic light.<br/><br/>Set just after the Civil War, the series portrays the ongoing story of a lovely young Boston doctor, Michaela Quinn, who following the death of her own physician father, moves to the frontier town of Colorado Springs. There Dr. Mike sets up her medical practice, to the consternation of those upset at the novel prospect of a female physician. Byron Sully, a rugged mountain man (and friend to the Cheyanne) helps her adjust to frontier life, and naturally the pair develop a mutual attraction. She is aided by a midwife, Charlotte Cooper, who on her deathbed following a snake bike, places her three children (Colleen, Brian, and the older Matthew) in Dr. Mike's care. Thus the doctor takes upon herself the responsibility of three adopted children. Later Dr. Mike marries Sully and they have a baby of their own, little Katie, to add to their previously existing foster family.<br/><br/>The beautiful British actress, Jane Seymour, is radiant, appealing, and sympathetic as the frontier doctor. Dr. Quinn certainly displays an admirable strength of wit and character, tackling both a challenging career and an instant family in this rugged pioneer setting. Yet she also reveals a touching vulnerability. The chemistry is electric between her and Sully (charismatically played by actor Joe Lando) and that factor is probably responsible for much of the show's success. On the whole, it's an engaging series and when it first aired, proved from my perspective superior to much of that era's TV programming.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "29 out of 35 found this helpful.", "date": "4 May 2006"}, {"title": " THE Western drama of our time", "content": "Where do I begin with this incredible show. Bravo to to CBS and Beth Sullivan for realizing America was more than ready for another hit Western series, long after GUNSMOKE ended. What genius ability went into this production. In fact, that's an understatement. From its fascinating 3-hr premiere; not only were modern viewers captivated by a new television western, but that it starred mini-series queen herself, Jane Seymour, in the title role.<br/><br/>Though most of the pilot characters were recast; kicking off the first season; it was all in good standing. The best replacement was Henry Sanders (ROBERT E). He brought so much more fire and personality to that role. And the introduction of 'Grace', whom he would later marry, was most endearing. Then, Sullivan needed a much younger, attractive 'Jake'; understood. How quaint, her own spouse, actor Jim Knobeloch, deemed perfect! <br/><br/>'Sully' would become Joe Lando's signature role. No actor could have replaced him. He will always be regarded as Byron Sully. William Shockley was unforgettable as 'Hank'. How could you honestly hate the guy? Yes he could be seriously temperamental at times, but he was always honest, and those gorgeous baby blues; he sure gave Sully a run for the ladies! <br/><br/>This show brought the frontier life to a whole new perspective. It was kept real. Here you had a Bostonian raised, refined woman physician; trained under the masterful eye of her own physician father, endearing chance by taking a huge risk to move far away from home, to a wilderness she knew nothing about. Naturally upon her arrival, townsfolk would not take to her so keenly. A woman doctor was historically and realistically unheard of, in 1850. Obviously, a few colleges provided medical training to female physician's. However, like our 19th and 21st Amendments; they also were not taken seriously; still treated abhorrently as 'Assistant's, rather than certified doctors.<br/><br/>And the Native American's. Their story was vividly portrayed, not just in the Washita incident, but also during the many trials with the Federal and Union Armys. This wasn't a typical shoot-em-up-cowboys-and-indians drama. It was history - brought to life. That is also what captivated audiences. <br/><br/>Jessica Bowman taking over 'Colleen': Yes fans were disappointed. However, I felt Bowman brought a newer, fresh approach to the role, and adapted quite well. She eventually came through and made it her own. Besides, I seriously doubt any actual screen chemistry between (Ericka) Flores and the future 'Andrew'(Brandon) Douglass. <br/><br/>Larry Sellers.....was legendary as 'Cloud Dancing'. What more can one say? I know I totally fell in love with him! Ingenious idea; matching him with 'Dorothy', during S5. Their screen chemistry was undeniable. I grew even more captivated witnessing the love blossom between them.<br/><br/>And lest not forget, the addition of Daniel Simon; Legendary hunk - former 'Duke boy', John Schneider. Had producers decided Sully get killed off, Daniel would have been the only suitable mate choice for Mike.<br/><br/>Shame to CBS for prematurely canceling it. There were several areas of blame; none of which were true. And most sadly, there has never been another series quite like this, today. The writers were exceptional, the directors brought scenes to life, and Sullivan made us fall in love with ALL her characters.<br/><br/>Hats off to you, Ms. Sullivan, for the finest of the American frontier.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "19 out of 22 found this helpful.", "date": "27 May 2010"}, {"title": " A Show That's All Heart!", "content": "This is quite possibly the best show to ever be aired on television!

And it's a tale about the great West and the little happenings of a small town called Colorado Springs. Dr. Mike is a strong-willed, compassionate and independent woman who dedicated her life to helping others. Jane Seymour's performance in every episode, from beginning to end, was phenomenal. Joe Lando was also excellent as the beloved Sully. I love the romance they both share with each other and how they build their family around it. They are the sexiest couple of all time and have outstanding chemistry together that's evident in every episode! Their love story is one of the greats. I most definitely have more than one favorite episode, among them would have to be when Sully proposes to Michaela, when Dr. Mike and Sully finally get married, and when little Katie is born. The show sends out such a wonderful message about always doing what's right and sticking together as a family. It's also about loss and learning how to put the pieces back together again and finding joy in the little things. Each and every character adds to the success of the show and it just wouldn't be the same without them all. You really get to know them with each passing season and they almost become like family.

Colleen, a young woman who wants nothing more than to be a doctor like her mother, and Brian, a young boy who tries to fit in with his peers, are Michaela and Sully's adopted children.

Fact: The genocide that human garbage such as Custer and Chivington did to the Native Americans was well documented and treated very solidly during the two parter where Custer slaughtered Native Americans at Washita. Fact: After the Civil War, many people including single women, very few but they did make the trek, moved West because of the nightmarish slaughter of the War. Also it's spelled History or if you wanted to say Herstory, it's Her Story. You need to go back to school or take some anger management classes, given your hostile and laughable comment on a great show. Only drawback was the last season where Sully was living in a cave after killing that insect Sgt. O'Connor played very well by Patrick Kilpatrick.

Perhaps, too far ahead. As correctly pointed out in previous comments, the show ran for two seasons on ABC from 1965 to 1967. One season in black and white, the other in color. 66 episodes were produced and every one of them was a comedic masterpiece. Despite poor ratings and eventual cancellation, the show went on to become extremely popular in syndicated reruns and develope a large cult following. So what happened? Here is my opinion. At the time F Troop made it's debut, Television was still in it's infancy and America was use to either the \"family\" sitcoms such as \"Donna Reed\", \"Beaver\", \"Ozzie and Harriet\", etc... Or, the \"idiot\" sitcoms such as \"Gilligan\", \"Bewitched\" or \"Jeannie\". The nation was not ready for, nor did the understand the \"Satire\" comedy. Two came out in 1965. One worked, the other didn't. \"Get Smart\" was a satire of the secret agent phenomenon which was sweeping the country. America could relate to that because of \"James Bond\" and the cold war so \"Get Smart\" was a success. Plus you had the great talents of Don Adams and a superb show to boot! But a satire on the American west? The nation didn't get it or take to it thus \"Troops\" fate was sealed. Despite the fact that the show is brilliant, the chracters are funny and endearing and the writing was superb and ahead of it's time, America just didn't get it. Only when times changed in the 70's and 80's and the show was in syndication did America start getting the humor and understanding what satire really meant. \"F-Troop\" paved the way for satires like \"Police Squad\" and \"The Naked Gun\". To this day the humor is fresh and funny and even relevant. I have seen episodee hundreds of times and still laugh and still find things I didn't notice before.

If you can't laugh at yourself, why bother at all?<br/><br/>It's so easy to apply today's standards to people from a different time.  It would be more appropriate for us to understand that different time.  I suppose we should criticize the way blacks were treated in movies made in the 1920s, 30s 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and so on.

Officious, pompous people are made fun of. Everyone is fodder for fun - no-one is above being poked at.<br/><br/>Ken Berry as William Parmenter is amazing in his comic timing (Mayberry RFD was a big step down for me).

Ernie Bilko - master mechanic and master con-man. But F-TROOP would eventually prove to be better than this. It was (and remains) the most successful satire/spoof of westerns (except possibly MAVERICK or BEST OF THE WEST) ever on television.<br/><br/>Set in the years immediately after the American Civil War, it describes how Wilton Parmenter, who was promoted for accidental heroism at the close of the war, was assigned to command the men of F-Troop in Fort Courage out west. He is a kindly, rather clumsy person. He is lucky that the actual man running the fort is the master sergeant Morgan O'Rourke (Forest Tucker). Assisted by the less than bright Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch) O'Rourke runs O'Rourke Enterprises, which sells various items (many of them trinkets) made by the local Hakawi Indian tribe (led by Chief Wild Eagle (Frank DeCova). The Fort has other figures in it: Trooper/Bugler Dobbs (James Hampton), Trooper Duffy (Bob Steele - the old cowboy movie star), Trooper Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks), and Trooper / translator Hoffenmuller (John Mitchum - Robert Mitchum's brother). We are sometimes told that other troopers have names like Lewis, Clark, Gilbert, Sullivan, Rogers, Hammerstein, etc. All these men are misfits. Vanderbilt (the Fort's look-out) is terribly nearsighted (and his tower keeps being accidentally toppled by friendly cannon fire). Duffy is listed as dead in action - with reason: he keeps talking of his experience of fighting shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo, which nobody survived. Hoffenmuller is a gifted linguist, speaking twenty Indian languages fluently. Unfortunately, he doesn't speak English, but German.<br/><br/>Parmenter is concerned about his command, and curious about what is going on (although O'Rourke keeps him firmly in the dark). But he is also occupied with Wrangler Jane Swift (Melody Patterson), a \"Calamity Jane\" clone who is pretty and immediately smitten by Wilton - much to his embarrassment before the men.<br/><br/>As for the Hakawis Wild Eagle keeps finding his position threatened by his heir. The heir (who turns out to be a gourmet cook in one episode) is usually outmaneuvered by the Chief. In the first episodes there was also an elderly medicine man, Roaring Chicken, played by Edward Everett Horton, but the role was not continued in the second half of the first season, nor in the entire second season. Pity, because Horton's medicine man was interesting. In one episode he prepared chicken soup as a medication.<br/><br/>As one can see the show had a wonderful goofiness in it. Parmenter turns into a martinet when he studies a course in leadership given by General Custer. Agarn is wined and dined by two rival candidates for Mayor of his town in New Jersey, because he can cast the deciding vote (he ends up voting for an old vaudevillian, who becomes known as the \"Dancing Mayor\" - at the time actor/dancer George Murphy had just been elected U.S. Senator from California). George Gobel, playing Wrangler Jane's cousin who is an inventor, demonstrates a folding table to Parmenter. He proudly says it can be put into a closet. \"What's the use of having a table in a closet?\", a confused Parmenter asks an equally flummoxed Gobel.<br/><br/>It is revived on occasion, and is well worth watching when it is shown.

Whenever Parmenter would get into a sticky situation with visiting brass, it was always Sgt. O'Rourke and Cpl.

James Hampton (who would go on to play Burt Reynolds' sidekick in THE LONGEST YARD and Michael J.

The addition of Dobbs to F Troop is a somewhat curious one because since Dobbs was a Southerner and the Civil War had just ended, Hannibal Dobbs would have, in reality, been ineligible for service in the United States Army. Ineligible or not, Dobbs was still hilarious and I even liked his back and forth banter with Agarn (\"I'm Warning you, Dobbs!\") If I were Captain Parmenter, I would have finished, \"Jane. How many times have I told you? Not in front of the men.\" with \"Why don't we go into my bedroom?\" (Note: during the Second Season, Melody Patterson was, in fact, of legal age.) I also liked the entrepreneurial Hekawis, Wild Eagle and Crazy Cat. They weren't your typical Indians. They were opportunistic Capitalists with good heads for business - almost as good heads as O'Rourke and Agarn. My favorite episode has got to be \"Our Brave in F Troop\". The one where Chief Wild Eagle has a toothache and he has to visit the Army Dentist. Unfortunately, there are a number of delays in getting the Chief's tooth pulled.

The child actor playing Dion is, as other reviews have often noted, very obnoxious. He is poorly behaved and his lack of discipline takes the focus away from more pressing story points in a negative way. The mother is no better. Her friends are abusive and mean and, despite knowing that she is right about her son, she just takes the abuse and moves on like they are justified in treating her the way they do. If she was on drugs and they were scolding her, that would be justified. She tells them her child has super powers and they don't seem to be concerned for her condition or try to humor her at all. Instead they threaten to call child services if she doesn't act right and they do it with zero emotional attachment as if they can't stand her. WHAT!?!?\nThe only scenes that were interesting to watch included Jordan and, in the first few episodes, were very few and far between.\nThis show was an amazing premise with horrible execution. It has everything going for it, takes off at a sprint but trips over it's own feet at the start of the race. It falls so far behind early on, it stands no hope of winning and should just bow out.", "rating": 4, "helpful": "15 out of 20 found this helpful.", "date": "26 January 2020"}, {"title": " When someone says don't listen to the bad reviews and gives it a 10, Yeah don't listen to them.", "content": "Like one user stated above, It's almost like Hallmark or lifetime made it.

We have more than enough procedural cop dramas already and The Librarians is a unique franchise that I have watched since the very 1st movie The Spear of Destiny. With a show like this it could go 10 seasons with a strong following because everyone I know loves the show. My nephew and I watch it every week and play the repeats on Hulu every weekend and he is just 15 so millennials obviously love the show too. And their are so many stories that are left to tell literally hundreds of storylines can be told that haven't been touched on yet with all the ancient stories of magic and gods/goddesses and magical creatures that have never been mentioned in the show yet. So why is TNT pulling the plug on the show? It is about the only show I watch on that network anymore. Like when SYFY pulled Warehouse 13 I stopped watching it until Krypton just started playing. Maybe if TNT doesn't come to their senses and renew the show you can try Netflix, Hulu or Amazon if nothing else try WGN to continue the show, so don't stop writing and filming because I bet their is a network that will be smart enough to know a good investment when they see it and we will be there to watch it.

Still, surprisingly, I didn't found difficult to understand the premise of this show; and the characters that were part of the movies, and also appeared in the pilot, were introduced in a manner that a \"new\" viewer would understand who was who without the show loosing its rhythm. This is also my very first review so bare with me if is not up to standard. I get there's a lot of negative reviews to this show either by people considering it inferior to the movies, in the first season Noah Wyle is \"just\" a star guest (due to his other show is still being shot) but he is the producer and he promises to have a bigger participation if there is a season two; others claim is just a rip off of several other shows; others don't like the actors. To each their own, you should evaluate by yourself. This show is, above all, a parody of many other shows and movies, it should be seen like that, the show doesn't take itself seriously, so should't you. Is not the kind of show you see for the great special effects, for the amazing and innovative dialog or plot. You see it for the humor it puts in parodying other movies and shows. Of course the fights aren't perfectly choreographed, they're mocking the ones that actual are (the suspension of disbelief is more often used in the latter than in the first), there's a friendly wink of the eyed towards the audience, sort of \"you know, no matter how, the hero always wins the fight, right?\". I found the actors/characters have good chemistry and they are having their own development.- Also, both as part of the main cast or as guests, there's some serious names starring on this show. Finally is a show who doesn't recur to swearing, gore violence or such to entertain us, is good, simple, honest fun, suitable for the entire family. Sadly there aren't many shows of whom we can say the same, are there. Please, see it first before reaching a conclusion.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "11 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "17 January 2015"}, {"title": " The show entertains and keeps things interesting in a fun way.", "content": "I'm enjoying the show. I happen to have watched the movies so I can understand if people are turned off by not knowing what is going on....but I can't understand why they aren't capable of watching the movies; or at least the final movie which clocks in at 93 minutes, the equivalent of a 2-hour episode.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes the premise of the series - magic items run amok - has been explored many times before because it is an easy way to keep the series fresh (Friday the 13th: The Series did this successfully almost three decades ago just like Warehouse 13 did recently.) The tone of the show, just like the movies, is light and a bit adventure-y though there are some darker themes that run throughout. Two in particular keep cropping up and revolve around the issues of impending death and violation of trust. How's that for lighthearted, eh?<br/><br/>Having seen all 8 episodes (the 2 ep finale is next week), I think it's very fair to say the debut episode is weak. By episode 4 the series really hit its stride and the characters are fleshed out fully. One thing that can't be stressed enough is how good the writing is for a fun-based TV show. I'm prone to pick apart shows for missing obvious plot holes or failing to exploit obvious solutions, over-using dues ex machina, or not following their own in-story logic. Of course we are talking about magic here so any real world logic may not hold up in the show. Just roll with it. Anything you find that is illogical at least appears to be about moving things along and not a cut corner on the storytelling.<br/><br/>The writers put a lot of effort into making the stories interesting even when the premise is lame and hokey. The Fables episode was dumb and the ending was trite but it gave one of the weaker characters a chance to save the day and laid an easter egg for the season finale right under our noses that you won't see until a few episodes later if at all. It also had some LOL visual gags and puns. Stone's evolution into a princess was great and Cassandra being Prince Charming was just so weird as to be awesome. And sometimes the premise is cool. The Heart of Darkness is a horror-lite tale that really delivers on the twists and turns, never mind that we got an amazingly dark internal reflection from one of the main characters near the end.<br/><br/>The actors' chops range from good to meh but what really makes the show is how they interact. By episode 3 you know how and why each one of them relates to the other, why they decide to remain together, why they decide to do what they do, and it makes sense based on who they are established as being. And the show delivers on keeping all that alive and moving it forward. <br/><br/>When White has popped in, he's an actual part of the story not a tag-on but the show rightly treats him like who he is - a guest star. The show still remains firmly about the core cast. Larroquette is the powerhouse though. There's a reason he's won 5 Emmys. It's probably a good thing we only see bits and pieces of him. He chews up the scenery like a Langolier. I love it. <br/><br/>The show also uses it's limited screen time to actually tell a story. There are only 10 episodes (20 if it gets renewed, and it prob will) and there is little throwaway dialog or scene. A vague reference here, an incidental development there, an innocuous conversation over yonder, all seem to connect together to tell a bigger picture once you start seeing the pattern. <br/><br/>And screen time isn't wasted with plot moving. In The Rule of Three, an important plot hole that I thought would be missed is plugged up but it occurs off camera which is why it caught me off guard when it unfolded. What we get instead of wasting time watching the character think of and set up the idea is the most important part, the action itself and one line of dialog that totally explains everything and saves us a precious minute of story telling.<br/><br/>So grab a snack and sit down for an hour of fun.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "11 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "12 January 2015"}, {"title": " Popcorn TV aimed at teens", "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect firing up the Librarians.

Again, almost like a drama. The cast are fantastic. Particularly the women. But all the actors are as unafraid of playing the ruder comedy as they are to play the emotional truth of each character. <br/><br/>There are so many twists and turns and some hilarious set pieces - the girl getting stuck in her jumpsuit in the toilet... the *mess* Kate makes on the floor... and there is a hilarious prank call that.. as everything else, packs an emotional punch too.

Suddenly she doesn't want her daughter to get to know her better? <br/><br/>But of course she relents and by the end, \"what Lacey learns in the process profoundly changes her view of her mother.\" Well isn't that nice and wrapped up? Except it's apparently not. By episode 7 (All in the Family), when Megan's ex-husband asks her to fill in for him and pick Lacey up at a friend's house the next day, Megan has to call Lacey to make sure she's really all right with that. Why? Well, as Megan explains, \"the last time I saw you, you said I was trying too hard.\" Uhm, no she didn't.

Awwww, how sweet -- and completely unrealistic of a turnaround. <br/><br/>According to the back story, she's been working with these people for 4 years in the coroner's office, but they write their interactions as if they only started working together a few weeks ago. Now in episode 3 she suddenly cares about their lives? Why? What was the catalyst? There wasn't one. At least not one the writers bothered to take any time to *build*. No, all it took was her boss, Kate Murphy (played by Jeri Ryan) telling her she might try showing an interest in her colleagues. She's never said that to her before in the past 4 years? And that simple request was enough to make her Mrs. Nice Gal? <br/><br/>This show is trying too hard to mimic \"Bones\", while not-so-successfully pretending not to. And just so we \"get it\", in episode 7 (All in the Family) the writers have Megan's ex show up at her office because he needs a Forensic Anthropologist, which Megan must, of course, remind him that she isn't. That would, strangely (because this is supposedly the coroner's office, not The Jeffersonian), be her boss. Or should I say her boss's boss.

(I accept the real life politics may be more complicated than that, but I'm presenting it as the show does).<br/><br/>The success of \"The Night Manager\" allowed the production staff to secure another couple of big names for this, Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon both play key roles in the Israeli counter intelligence and though both have lots to do, they're outshone by Florence Pugh, a genuine star on the rise, as Charlie - the actress at the centre of the scheme. That said, performances generally are excellent, as is the recreation of the 1970's in various locations around the globe.<br/><br/>For me though, the show doesn't get the balance between character building and plot progression right. I feel you could have cut the show from 6 to 4 episodes without sacrificing much and still making the characters motivations and misgivings as believable as they are. As much as I like Alexander Skarsgard too, I do feel he was a bit miscast in this. Staring wistfully doesn't come naturally to him, and I'd presume it's not easy to blend in as a spy when you're 8 feet tall and look like a model. There are some strange choices made in directing the piece too. In each episode there is at least one bizarre crashing zoom onto someone's face that feels like it was set up for another take that they decided to keep in.<br/><br/>I like a slow burn drama, giving characters a chance to breath - but unfortunately I think that \"The Little Drummer Girl\" takes that a bit too far.

It's hard to believe that this is the first time she had to deal with life drama while her mother isn't there.\nShe is probably 14 and in all those years, her mother only had one topic: Mars.

Repeat\".<br/><br/>Sometimes it suffers a bit from acting as if some characters are \"wise\" or might suddenly say \"the answer\" (to life and everything I suppose) - a lot of things \"happen\", and then the characters are generally busy seeking meaning, and we happen to be there, so we are along for the ride. But they are as muddled as anyone in the world, more so maybe. If you stop looking for meaning, just fall in love with the characters, and appreciate the series of heists, showdowns, coincidences and cinematography, it is more enjoyable, and watchable.<br/><br/>For me, the brother Yuto is a bit irritating to watch in episode 1 - maybe because he has so many \"soft focus\" \"in the past\" scenes, which make him look and act like a model for photos that come free/ready installed in new photo frames than a real person. The other characters are all engaging, and only he is the odd man out in this episode. Also, this is the odd-episode-out too - yuto improves.<br/><br/>There is some unevenness in what is possible/impossible in this created universe, especially around fight scenes and show downs - sometimes the characters are unbeatable/unstoppable in their gunfighting skills, callous professional heisting and doing the job of the gangster/police/yakuza.

I do like the wide variety of characters, but the show, to me, is too unrealistic for normal standards. The school is perfect, with its Sushi Bar (yes, a SUSHI BAR) and hardly any rules (for example, the guys seem to always be allowed in the girls' dorms - wouldn't happen). Anyways, what bothers me even more is that the main character Zoey (Spears) is perfect, also. She is SO popular, everyone in the whole school seems to know her and completely love her. Example, the episode with the exams. EVERYONE asks Zoey to help her, as if she is the only smart one in the school. Please. And the episode with the backpacks, amazingly, she makes about a hundred of them with those radio things in like what, less than two days...? It always seems like she has an idea for everything, and in the end the whole cast congratulates her and loves her even more. It really bothers me a lot.<br/><br/>Also, on top of that all, I have to say that the acting isn't all that great. Jamie Spears, in my opinion, didn't earn or deserve the main part in this show, if the show had to be made at all. When I first saw her in All That (1995), I thought that she actually had some talent. Well, the role of Zoey Brooks turned me off. She doesn't have much emotion or facial expression in what she says or does. In the very first episode, where she plays basketball, she isn't that good at all. And of course, the coach asks her to join the team and says she is \"great\". Also, in the episode with the school play, guess who makes the lead role? Yup, you guessed it. Zoey. She can't act, why did she make the lead? And, WHY does every boy want to kiss her? Is she really THAT pretty? And that Nicole (Alexa Nikolas), well she isn't anything special either. Kristen Herrera, even though she left the show, wasn't very good either. All the other actors are typical and somewhat boring. There isn't much going on. I'd have to say that the best actors on the show (my opinion) are Erin Sanders (Quinn) and Paul Butcher (Dustin). They are a little more believable. And I can't stand the fact that, and this happens all the time, The actors aren't true to the age group. They are made to look older than the average grade 8 student (I think they are in grade 8).<br/><br/>Overall, this show bothers me a lot. A lot of it makes you want to just scream \"Yeah Right\" when you are watching. And I know this is only a show, so pushing the limits is common and bound to happen, but this show sticks out for me. For grade 8 thirteen year olds, they are going to want to be just like Zoey, and they can't. Because Zoey is perfect. She goes to a perfect school, has perfect clothes, is so popular, the list goes on. Not any normal girl. I'm going to give this show a 5/10. Because even though it's as unrealistic as a tween show can get, there's something about it that wants you to keep watching it.

Now, where have I heard these characters before? I am sorry, but what is so wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about Science, and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect, in which the rest should be concerned about as well, she is \"weird\" and a \"nerd\"?

And another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her.

After season one's end, I really looked forward to season 2, which just premiered, although after watching the first episode, I noticed something was different, the cast went from kids to teenagers, of course it may seem silly that I said that cause all kids grow up, but it really changes the whole mood, where even the bushy haired kid isn't as dorky anymore.

You had entertaining acts like You Can't Do That on Television. You had weird but good shows like Pete &amp; Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. As I tried watching Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust.<br/><br/>The setting couldn't of been more fake than this one. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, boasting everything that a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen TVs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. The kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. It looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college.<br/><br/>The characters were also a factor that turned me off. Every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. Only leading her to have no other side. I've been through school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is dumb. Logan plays the arrogant tough guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is just well, a tough person. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique for these characters, and different from other personalities? Is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with? Instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. There is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence, facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. Through that period they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions, and do what's right for them. Zoey 101 contains nothing of those values. In this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. I'm sorry, but that simply isn't true. People can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. If I expect things in Zoey 101 to happen in real life, then I would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house. Nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues. Neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face. It displays a horrible message for kids and I highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. A horrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage Nickelodeon has been making in recent years.<br/><br/>1 out of 10.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "15 out of 23 found this helpful.", "date": "25 January 2008"}, {"title": " Zoey 101", "content": "I don't care whatever anyone else says I think it is a brilliant show.

With her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that Nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism.

It gave us a glance of a new way of comedy and especially for Nickelodeon, I get why people hated it. It was unrealistic. Yeah I'll agree with that. But shows like this aren't meant to be realistic.

All of the characters attend PCA, this unbelievable boarding school with painted, stylish dorms. The campus seems to have no reasonable rules - for instance, the boys are often seen in the girls' dormitories, and vice versa. But this may be simply because the dorm adviser, a silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them, as I assume her purpose is supposed to be, sits around and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools, and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show.<br/><br/>Next, the characters. I was so disappointed to discover that Nickelodeon wasn't creative at all with the personalities in this show. They all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does (looks, grades, sports, guys, judgment, creativity, etc), Michael is the jock, Logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers, Nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight-A's, Dana was the tough girl, Quinn is the unrealistic 'smart kid,' whom they consistently make fun of, Chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his 'true feelings' which really aggravates me as the show continues, and that new girl- Lola or something- is just another clone of Nicole.<br/><br/>The main two characters that aggravate me the most are Zoey and Quinn. First of all, I just do not understand Zoey's character. She was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as I said above, but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them- in most of the episodes she creates a problem, then has to fix it. What's frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven't even created a very realistic character to begin with.<br/><br/>Quinn, on the other hand, bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting. The impression I get from Nick concerning her character is that 'geeks' and 'nerds' are people to laugh at, to criticize, to mock. In the spring break episode they did a year ago, they introduced two more 'nerds' who the characters had to make 'cool.' I found this highly offensive and stereotypical. What kind of message is Nick sending to these kids? Is it: Don't do well in school, don't get good grades, don't study hard- you'll end up being a geek and we will mock your profession in future television series!

I've seen the most sick and disgusting movies ever filmed throughout the world so I'm not squeamish but the scene featuring the murder of the strawberry dairy farmer is nothing to balk at for a TV series. It may only last about 30 seconds but the scene is very graphic and horrifying due to it's realistic appearance and overly harsh tone.<br/><br/>People by now should understand and have a good grasp of the many terrifying ways someone can be killed or hunted down during those 12 hours murder becomes legal.

The sexual tension between Angela and Tony is what everyone seems to remember when they discuss this show, and the writers kept it going for seven years before the characters finally confessed their love.

Actually, there are two families here who sort of merge into one, both physically (sharing the same house) and emotionally (sibling spats and so on, but genuine care &amp; concern).<br/><br/>The series revolves around a fairly affluent, divorced New York City advertising executive, Angela Bauer, who lives in a lovely colonial home in Connecticut with her rather shy &amp; insecure young son, Jonathan. There are frequent visits from her man hungry mother, Mona, who eventually moves into an apartment over the garage. In the meantime, Angela hires an unusual, macho appearing Italian housekeeper hunk from Brooklyn, Tony Micelli, who is anxious to give his teenage daughter, Samantha, the greater opportunities that accompany a suburban life. Tony &amp; Sam move in and the two families combine, so to speak.<br/><br/>The relationship between Angela and Tony makes this series. Angela, the serious career woman, begins to rely heavily on Tony not only for domestic management, but also as a surrogate dad for son Jonathan. In the process Tony and Angela become best friends, share both laughs and tears, and exchange advice on everything from clothing styles to parenting to love interests. Naturally, romantic feelings develop between Angela and Tony and the chemistry &amp; sexual tension of this unconsummated relationship are at the heart of the ongoing story. There are some pretty funny situations...Angela &amp; Tony kissing after becoming a bit tipsy, Tony inadvertently walking in on Angela as she's just getting out of the shower, a scenario where the pair are forced to sleep in the same bed. Are you getting the picture? This ongoing situation is just so much more entertaining than modern sitcoms where everyone hops into bed straight away.<br/><br/>Judith Light and Tony Danza are both magnificent in their roles. Light plays the workaholic, uptight Angela to perfection and no one could possibly impart more charisma to housekeeper Tony than Danza does. Katherine Helmond is brilliantly cast as the vixen mother, Mona. Danny Pintauro plays the cute Jonathan and Alyssa Milano puts real pizazz into her portrayal of Sam, a pretty &amp; very social teenager who, typical of her age, is constantly on an emotional roller coaster and keeps the household in a state of continuous uproar. <br/><br/>This is a brilliant and hilarious series with a clever, unique take on the employer / employee relationship.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "22 out of 25 found this helpful.", "date": "24 April 2006"}, {"title": " One of the best sit-coms ever...", "content": "I love Who's the Boss, and I would absolutely rate it as one of the best sit-coms ever, even though I have rarely if ever seen it actually given this credit.

There are a lot of very good sit-coms that can offer one or a few of the aspects that Who's the Boss offers, but only WTB has it all.

Tony Danza as a warm, caring but overprotective father. Judith Light as an uptight, conservative executive. Alyssa Milano and Danny Pintauro played the children perfectly. What was interesting is how the characters evolved so well as the times changed. In the latter parts of the episodes, Angela has learned to be more relaxed. Sam and Jonathan have become more like siblings as evidenced by their fights in some of the episodes. The only character I didn't like was Billy, but it's great that they got rid of him. The kid was a good actor, it's just he didn't 'fit'.

Mona's insults to her daughter,Jonathan who was funny when he was little is not as funny in his teens.<br/><br/>The only other thing is,although the growing love relationship between Tony &amp; Angela was written well,it seems in some shows they make a point that was made sometime ago and you just want them to say I love you already.<br/><br/>The greater things stand out though,which is how these two very different families blend in over time with each other. Starting right with the very first show (and the memorable second where Tony sees Angela as she gets out of the tub!)

Who's The Boss is undoubtedly one of the best family-based sitcoms ever: a divorced but wealthy career woman, going by the name of Angela Bauer, -played by Judith Light- lives at home with her son, Jonathan and whose mother, Mona occasionally drops by to pay a visit. Angela hires a hunky, ex- Major League baseball player, Tony Michelli- Taxi's Tony Danza- as her housekeeper: he brings along his daughter, Samantha, played by Charmed's Alyssa Milano and the pair move into Angela's house. <br/><br/>Angela is uptight-some would say pretentious and is yet a well- educated, intelligent and ambitious woman, who at first, is so tied to her work that she doesn't seem to have time to relax and have fun with the kids. Tony on the other hand, is a fun-loving, humorous, New Yorker, whose mischievous and larger than life persona springs to life from the very first moment he enters Angela, Jonathan and Mona's lives. Amidst the positive effect he has on not just the kids and Mona, but Angela especially. And it is down to his effect on Angela, that as we see as the series progresses, she becomes less uptight and more sensitive, caring and loving, in addition to being more assertive and confident. Both as a mother to the kids and towards Tony, particularly as her feelings towards him develop further on, from employees, to friends, and then onwards as lovers. The emotional and sexual tension between Angela and Tony is well developed and the writers and performers did a good job in projecting that chemistry and making those characters believable, to the extent to which we as the audience, wanted to root for them to get together. <br/><br/>Thus, the fact that Who's The Boss, managed to sustain the interest in Angela and Tony's relationship throughout the 8 seasons, without it diminishing the standards this show has set is a testament to the quality of the writing, the humour and the performances themselves. <br/><br/>Today, Judith Light is well known to many of us for her role as stern, no-nonsense, Claire Meade in ABC's Ugly Betty, but here as Angela, she is wonderful as she plays against type as a down-to-earth, sensitive-yet modest career woman and single mother. Personally, for me it was refreshing to see a younger Judith, looking beautiful and elegant throughout this sitcom. <br/><br/>Having seen Ugly Betty and Who's The Boss, I can understand why she is considered by many people- within the TV industry and outside of it- as a great character actress. She has this ability to play certain roles that are as varied and diverse, as well as ones that challenge her acting capabilities. Her level of experience on screen and stage, not to mention her knowledge of this business, from an acting perspective makes her one of the most well respected and under rated actresses around today. And with 'Who's The Boss?' Judith hardly puts a foot wrong; she looks radiant and glamorous as the attractive Angela. Tony Danza is as charismatic, charming and witty as he is as Tony and together, the pair make a great sitcom couple. <br/><br/>There are many sitcoms which encompass the romantic pairing of two characters, but not many shows are able to develop that chemistry and relationship further along throughout the duration of the series and in a way that makes sense to its viewers. 'Who's the Boss?' with Tony and Angela, on the other hand, did just that, courtesy of the performances given by Danza and Light. It was at times amusing, interesting and touching, without being too sappy. <br/><br/>Overall, this was an underrated show that never got as much recognition that it deserved and is a likable take on the employer/employee relationship; a theme that was employed during the first 2 seasons of the 90s LL cool J and Debbie Allen sitcom, In the House. I have to admit I didn't like this show when it first came out, but as I watch the episodes as a 20 something person, it made me appreciate Who's The Boss more, as well as to understand and getting used to its humour. <br/><br/>As I said, the 80s was a great cultural period for Television in the States, and 'Who's The Boss?' was one of those shows that best reflected and represented American family life and culture during that decade, in the way that it did.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "2 out of 2 found this helpful.", "date": "29 March 2008"}, {"title": " When There was Still a Modicum of Ethnicity Recognition Left!!", "content": "Our parent's generation was full of ethnic and religious generalizations which dominated the population's thought patterns, particularly in urban areas, today that is no longer the case!!

Plain and simple. It didn't necessarily break any new grounds, or pursue any new formula. It just managed to be funny. Yes, Jim's character is a slob, a jerk, an insecure ass**** who needs reassurance. That is what drives a lot of the story lines, and I'm fine with that. But In typical sitcom fashion, he \"learns a valuable lesson\" in these said story lines to make him more manageable. Courtney Thorne-Smith plays his \"long suffering\" wife trying to cope with his antics. Yes, we've seen it before. But it was FUNNY. Kim Williams-Paisley plays Jim's SMOKING HOT sister-in-law, and of course those two are largely at odds with each other throughout the series run. But they also show true caring and affection for each other when the time comes. And Larry Joe Campbell plays Jim's best friend and brother-in-law, Andy. He plays the butt of many jokes regarding his luck with women, or for that matter life in general. I have no complaints, all of the main characters appeal to me just fine.<br/><br/>One of my favorite story arcs is where Jim is distraught over something regarding his infant son. For instance, his wife allowing him to wear a dress for Halloween. Or his wife buying him a Green Bay Packers football, despite Jim being a HUGE Chicago Bears fan (arch-rivals of the Packers), and hoping to pass that on to his son (like most parents do). This brings in a fantasy segment in which Jim speaks to a teen aged/young adult version of his son regarding the topic at hand. Yes, Jim may be a pompous jerk, an ass-hat, but he doesn't wrap the show up in \"his\" own viewpoints. There's still a moral, and still a concession made by such an opinionated man.<br/><br/>Really though, if you catch this one on TV, watch it. I don't see how Jim Belushi's character on this show is any harder to deal with then Doug Heffernan on King of Queens (who at first, I couldn't stand).

Kimberly Williams is very believable and refreshing as her Single Career Woman With Angst sister. Larry Joe (forgot his last name) is funny and sympathetic and happily helpless as her brother. <br/><br/>Lastly I mention Jim Belushi. He is just fab in his part as Courtney's hubby. It's both scary and exhilerating to watch him. It's like seeing John Belushi but all grown up and, well, normal (mentally). For years now, I've watched Jim and seen only John. Now, thanks to this show, I am finally seeing Jim for Jim. He is pure funny, great timing, great sincerity, and he knows how to be serious when it calls for it. Great dimension for a character who started out as little more than just a caricature. I've been delightfully amazed. He's quite good in this particular role (you know, like Ackroyd is just excellent as the balding Southern good ole boy of both Driving Miss Daisy and My Girl), and I hope this sitcom makes it for a few years so I can keep on enjoying it.<br/><br/>Courtney knows how to hold her own and then some against Jim. They walk the thin line between being the Bundies and the Bunkers and the Buchmans. Their chemistry is very on-target. Everyone's is, actually.<br/><br/>The arguments are quite believable. Good writing. I like the running joke about expanding vocabulary. <br/><br/>This show isn't Seinfeld or Cheers, but it is a solidly written comical commentary on married family life. Couples can watch together and both enjoy it, neither gender is spared, both are poked fun at and both are strongly represented.

A close friend, siblings or other persons that appears occasionally to provide more \"action\", and the husband makes all the wrong and bad things together with the friend, and the wife always forgives him.

Launched by ABC in the fall of 2002 with '8 Simple Rules', 'Life with Bonnie' and 'Less than Perfect', it was part of the network's pendulum swing away from the reality genera and back toward more audience-pleasing scripted family comedies. It's much better than a reality show, but a hard punch in the back of the head would be too. <br/><br/>So, now we're stuck with this monster. In that reality rebellion I'm afraid the audience may have given Jim Belushi, the cast and his writers the impression that they were actually funny. They aren't and as a sitcom the show is a waste of time and space on every level. How many ways can you say that something is bad? 'Jim' is nothing, like a spec of dust in the air. It has no distinct characters or comic talents. It has no vision or voice. It has no chemistry. It has no desire to do anything creative or original. It doesn't want to tell a story or even strain to hard to tell a joke. It wants to be escapism and get a laugh every now and then and it can't even do that. At the same time it isn't even bad up on an insulting level that I can get worked up and challenge it. <br/><br/>The show is headlined with another classic improbable sitcom odd-couple marriage in Belushi and Courtney Thorne-Smith ('Melrose Place', if that doesn't say it all). The husband/father is, typically, a tubby sports and sex-obsessed idiot always needing to be wrangled in by his more sensible, down to earth, and never wrong wife. As much as this TV husband lives in constant fear of not having sex, he is also so self absorbed that he will forgo opportunities for said sex so he can attend a football game, watch a football game or some other act of self indulgence. They make up cute at the end of each episode so they could go through the same thing again. None of these shows have the guts to end with their wives finally filing for divorce. <br/><br/>For those that haven't heard this a thousand times before: these kind of escapist sitcoms are designed to pander to the married/relationship set - for the husbands to fantasize that they can be as much a pig as they want and still get Courtney Thorne-Smith. Wives are to feel like they are doing an act of charity raising both their kids and childish husbands who are constantly screwing up and getting them into predicaments. We're all supposed to hold hands at the end, look into each others eyes and say \"that's just like us\" or \"it's so realistic\". That illusion of familiarity is the only thing that keeps these shows running. <br/><br/>Belushi, swallowing the slob sitcom clich\u00e9s whole-heartedly, is flat-out obnoxious. Everyone else, including Thorne-Smith, cute Kimberly Williams and Larry Joe Campbell (as Belushi's fat slob sidekick) run around and fall all over the place trying their paltry best to give this any signs of life. It is embarrassing to watch. <br/><br/>Next time I come across another one of these cookie-cutter sitcoms, I'm going to make it easy on myself and just cut and paste this review and change the names.

A character that particularly interests me is Amara De Escalones: a female crime boss that is masterfully portrayed by Lidia Porto. It is refreshing to see a female antagonist written and portrayed in such an original way. <br/><br/>The storylines that unfold throughout the first series of Get Shorty are compelling. The relatable nature of the characters, interwoven with the commentary on the film industry is perfect! The comedic elements also work nicely to cement these two unlikely components. I similarly like the crime genre style of the series which pays homage to other films such as Pulp Fiction. One of my favourite storylines follows the character Louis Darnell, played by Sean Bridgers. I like this character and his storylines because I find the moral conscience and humour of the character, combined with his interactions between O'Dowd's character, to be very intriguing.<br/><br/> \nOverall, I would highly recommend Get Shorty as the series is a pertinent statement of the film industry wrapped up in a television series which is well written, directed and acted.

If I had to pick the one I like the least, it would be the Irish guy. First of all, why is he Irish? They can't find an American actor for this part? An Irish gangster living in Nevada? He also is too soft to play a tough guy. He walks with a slouch, like he has a hunchback. He looks like he couldn't do two pull-ups, and maybe he can't. They also have his character all over the place, from loving father, uxorious husband, to sociopath and asshole. Which one is he? The show is too much fun to dwell on the matter of his integrity and character, all I'm saying is that I would have preferred someone else in the roll.<br/><br/>Unlike The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, Get Shorty doesn't go overboard on the family thing in this series, at least not yet. I hope they aren't saving that for season 3.<br/><br/>Like The Sopranos, Get Shorty is hysterically funny at times.

At least it's cool until it becomes a bit annoying, but at least it's fairly original and more than you would expect from a TV series where you really shouldn't expect anything.<br/><br/>I think it's useful to compare Get Shorty with another current series, Animal Kingdom. All of the things wrong with Animal Kingdom (AK) they get right on Get Shorty (GS). The first problem with AK is casting. The cast is a nightmare of extremely bad choices whereas GS gets everyone just right.<br/><br/>What truly sets GS apart from most of the bad stuff on TV is that they get all of the peripheral characters right, as well as the protagonists. Every single character in the show is fun to watch, from Miles's sidekick, Lulu, to Amara's half-witted and nihilistically violent nephew, Yago.<br/><br/>Almost every character is a scene stealer. Ray Romano almost walks away with the whole series, except he has a lot of competition.<br/><br/>I think that the story line in each of these two series is about the same quality, the thing that separates AK and GS (besides the casting) is the humor thrown in at necessary intervals in GS.<br/><br/>Take Amara's accountant as an example.

I'm no prude, and thank goodness I've stopped squirming. My normal reaction is that if a series is good in its original British guise, the Americanization will be awful. Not so here. QAF started for me as a superficial soap about gay life. But once the first season was half over, I was hooked. I found I cared deeply about these characters. Their insular gay world in Pittsburgh was refreshing. The relationships work beautifully and you see a fairly representative slice of gay life on this series. Sure everyone always seems to be showing up at the big gay club with its go-go dancers and steamy back room. But how wonderful to have a show all about gay people where nobody gets killed for being gay, or commits suicide or is in some sort of depression or any other negative situations that have been such a feature of films showing gay characters as life's losers. <br/><br/>Gale Harold's Brian took me totally by surprise. His no gamesmanship attitude towards sex and relationships makes total sense. What I responded to is his character's absolute refusal to be liked, unlike the very likable Michael (Hal Sparks) whose insecurity demands that he be liked. Brian's a stunning bad boy, confident of his looks, his talent, his ability to spot bullshit a mile away. He wants to be appreciated for his worth. Nothing wrong with that. He's unapologetic about his sexuality and is not obsessed with settling down into domestic bliss the way Michael is. Michael is a child, but a sweet one with his love of comic books, and his unresolved longing for Brian. His character's worry about everything has finally become endearing. Peter Paige's Emmett is adorable and heartbreaking. I love that he's always picking himself up after every romantic disaster, dusting himself off and heading towards the next with high hopes. Scott Lowell has a natural affinity for Ted Schmidt's insecure and manipulative accountant. I'd like him to settle down for awhile. I sometimes weary of his travails. <br/><br/>At first I thought Randy Harrison's sweetly beautiful Justin was going to be a fluffy love toy for Brian, but Justin's own problems have shown Brian's caring side, and you get to see that Justin is no dummy. He goes after what he wants. Nothing wrong with that. Sharon Gless's working Mom waitress can be abrasively grating at times, but she presents a loving mother to a gay son, and that's a good thing. Michelle Clunie as Melanie and Thea Gill as Lindsay strike me as an appealing, smart, and caring lesbian couple Their stability as a couple shows what is possible without proselytizing. <br/><br/>Now in its fifth season, I've come to appreciate the show in big gulps since I rent each season from Netflix. It's a real wallow, and I'm always sorry that it's over. Right now I'm deep into season four and I can't wait to find out what happens next. QAF is excellent series TV, vastly entertaining.

Brian and Michael are in their late twenties, gay and best friends. In the past three hours before this rooftop scene, Brian has had sex in a gay nightclub, hooked up with a 17-year old boy (whom he will deflower approximately one hour later) and has become a father. Michael, on the other hand, was about to have a one-night stand and realized but once again that he actually is secretly in love with Brian.<br/><br/>With drugs inside, Brian goes on a trip, climbs the edge of the roof, pulls Michael to him and whispers in his ear: \"Come on, Mickey, let's fly!\" In the background, Heather Small sings \"I step out of the ordinary\u0085\" It is a mild summer night in the middle of a sparkling city and there is magic in the air.<br/><br/>The first episode of \"Queer as folk\" was probably the sexiest, craziest, sweetest and best TV show premiere I've ever seen (well, apart maybe from \"Desperate Housewives\"). It really impressed me and woke my interest. But it was this magical moment Michael and Brian share on the roof that made me fall in love with this show. You can almost smell the night air, feel the warm summer wind breeze and know: it's one of those crazy, unusual moments that make us feel alive. The music, the atmosphere, the scenery \u0096 it's all perfect and goes straight under your skin into your heart and soul. The scene gives a promise to the viewer that in the future we will witness unusual, as well as profound and ordinary things, but most of all it is a promise that there will be more magical moments like this one and breathtaking surprises like the ones that happened previously and followed right after. And what better promise can a first episode give \u0096 and keep? We witness the lives of four gay friends, a newbie, a gay man's mother and a lesbian couple plus their friends, lovers, relatives and one-night-stands in Pittsburgh. Brian, the main character, is a selfish asshole and Casanova on the one hand and a vulnerable, caring, sweet young man on the other. Michael, whose relationship to Brian I have already described a bit, on the one hand loves his proud mother, on the other tries everything to pretend that he's straight at the supermarket he works in. Emmett, a sweetheart of a queen, always delivers flamboyant one-liners and looks for the man of his dreams. So does Ted, suffering from his not-classically-attractive looks, but having a heart of gold. Young Justin is about to discover the scene and has the (bad) luck to choose Brian as his first love(r).

But I would like to mention \"QAF\" 's greatest strength and maybe THE reason why this is a brilliant series. Today's TV shows have so many clich\u00e9s, try to judge, to label. You will find none of this in \"Queer as folk\". It just witnesses the lives of people without commenting on it, judging or trying to justify what they do. If they want to shag, they shag, if they want to take drugs, they do so without asking anyone's permission, if they want to party, they party and they make just as many and stupid mistakes as everyone does. Sometimes they screw up and there are times they don't know if they want to scream of joy or suffering. They just live and the show celebrates them for it. And what better message can it have? I know that the show was already a huge success in the US, I am glad that it finally reached Europe (or at least Germany) and I am very grateful that I have the opportunity to see it.

You've got Brian the man whore who doesn't believe in settling down, would rather party every night at Babylon than stay at home and await old age.

Then there's Ted, the older, boring, more down to earth guy that constantly deals with rejection and loneliness. Then they added the good guy drama to it to show that EVERYONE makes mistakes regardless of what life they lead by putting Ted through an HIV scare twice, and then bottoming out on a crystal-meth addiction. Emmett goes through an HIV scare as well and also takes on an extreme heartbreak when his lover and best friend turned on him and humiliated him. Debbie is a mother bird protecting her baby (Michael). Her use of foul language is her only defense to keep from getting ran over. Vic is a glimmer of hope to all HIV/AIDS viewers that it IS possible to have HIV and live to see old age, that its not always the end. Tell me now, how many people have had their heart broken?

It has incredible characterisation (capable of drawing even a straight man into the lives of the characters), beautiful cinematography, great acting and compelling writing. I have seen the first two seasons and I am currently watching the third on VHS because I lost showtime in the process. I have 3 episodes left of season 3 and, barring a few rather flagrant showings of male nudity (which although arguably contextually appropriate did seem a bit over the top), the shows have continued the quality of the first two seasons. What is great about the show is the fact that you really do care what happens to the characters, you can see an element of yourself in them (well maybe not all of them but you can find something in at least one of the characters that you relate to--I really relate to Ted myself, particularly in the middle of the first season and most of the third season). The show has tackled a lot of touchy topics (HIV, gay marriages, homophobic politicians) and, barring Emmett's brief fling with quack therapy in an attempt to be straight, they have been dealt with in a thoughtful, intelligent and sensitive manner (although how can you deal with reparative therapy seriously?), and, in a real stretch, showing that the gay community has its own flaws, which i think is what really sets the show apart, it says that the gay community isn't perfect and the gay characters aren't perfect.<br/><br/>And even though all my straight friends who have never seen the show may laugh and ask me if I have started to play for the other team, I will continue to watch as long as the quality is kept up like this.

My only beef is that Gale Harold may seem cold and rather like a jerk (since a stronger term may be censored but one is definately implied), Aidan Gillen was creepy. Gale was the kid in high school that was popular although he never really liked anyone while Aidan was that guy who you would see somewhere and he would just creep you out yet you couldn't take your eyes off him.

But then at the beginning of this year i kept seeing gifs and photosets about it on various blogs, so i gave in and just googled 'gay-themed' series and unsurprisingly it was rated as no.1 on AfterElton.com. So...i watched it, and the rest is history. I only watched it about 2 months ago. I watched all 5 seasons and 82 episodes in 6days. It was by far the best 6days of my life, even though i got no sleep and hardly ate...but it was so worth it!<br/><br/>Anyways, its changed me and influenced my thoughts and opinions profoundly, in the sense that, its made me more understanding and accepting and just in general made me want to be a better person and strive to better myself, to be grateful for my loving and supportive friends and family and most importantly, to be myself and stand up for myself-to be an active member of society.<br/><br/>As Peter Paige said, (actor who plays Emmett), \"they came for the queer, but stayed for the folk\".

Each and every character has so much personality and depth that you forget you're watching a TV show. <br/><br/>Its moved me in ways that no movie or book or real life event has ever moved me, and made me feel like i've never felt before.

I really don't know how to put my feelings into words, but basically after only a few episodes i'd became to emotionally and intimately involved and invested in the show and it characters, they became my friends and family, and after i finished watching it, i felt as if i'd lost my best friends and family. Even though i'm a straight 19 yr old girl, i felt i belonged with these group of people and could relate to them. I lived vicariously through each and every one of them and learnt so much about life in the process. <br/><br/>One of the many reasons i believe it impacted me so intensely was definitely the gay political and health issues it unapologetically explored in such a realistic and moving manner. It tackled issues i've never seen any other show handle before, especially in the 2000's gay rights had only just started being handled in the media and in politics, so i think it was extremely brave of the writers to portray these issues. It tackled issues from marriage equality, gay bashings, discrimination, politics, religion and sexuality, to, cancer, pornography, drug addiction, HIV/Aids, prostitution and adoption. <br/><br/>Overall, skipping all talk about the brilliant acting from all the cast and the AMAZING soundtrack (every song was part of a carefully selected playlist that matched in lyrics and rhythm and melody to its respective scene)...it was probably one of the best things thats happened in my life...and that is no exaggeration. I have watched it 5 times so far, and i love that every time i re-watch it, i discover something new about a character, or something new about their character development.<br/><br/>It is a truly masterful show, so complex in its relationships and beautifully put together.

During S1, Ted will go through a lot of challenges, including a near-death experience and experimentation with S&amp;M, and the relationship he has with a young man named Blake will be a guided tour through Ted's soul.<br/><br/>Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige) is one character who may have you judging, before you know him, to be one of those \"stereotypes\", the overtly \"gay\" man, the kind that dresses in screaming colors, has a certain way of speaking, moving, etc. Not to mention he works as a window-dresser at a little boutique. Again, as you get to know Emmett, you will make wonderful discoveries as he makes an interesting journey of his own. He is deep and human...I adore him! <br/><br/>And then there are Justin and Brian...holy moley...<br/><br/>I can describe them as individuals: Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison) is a senior at a prestigious private high school. Seventeen and luscious to behold, Justin is a genius artistically as well as academically. His sexuality is not ripening, it's exploding. He's not coming out, he's just plain out. The first time he decides to explore Liberty Avenue's club scene, he meets Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), a twenty-nine year old advertising executive. Seductive, sexual and smart as a whip, Brian is another character who will give you a first impression which will change dramatically, and that impression is that he is a self-centered, greedy slut who can't get enough. Without a doubt, Justin and Brian are my favorite couple (and whether Brian knows it, wants it, or admits it or not, they ARE a couple), and in my opinion, the most complex characters on the show. From the first time they meet, there is a chemistry there that is devastating. The sex scenes between these two are the very definition of the word \"delight\"...I have never seen a more erotic couple (gay or hetero) in my life. Like the other characters, these two have their share of problems. Brian is Justin's first lover, and Justin unabashedly professes his love over and over, only to be dismissed and broken-hearted time and again. Brian wants to be an enigma, but actions speak louder than words. He may talk like Justin was just another in his long list of casual conquests...the words may be cold and cynical, \"I don't believe in love, I believe in ____ing...\" but if you watch Brian's eyes, the nonverbal communication, you're going to get another message, loud and clear, even if it takes all season, as Justin proves himself brave and brazen and full of surprises.<br/><br/>Then there's the love that exists between Michael and Brian, best friends since age 14. Their bond is at once touching and potentially destructive as Michael begins a relationship with a handsome chiropractor. And Brian's relationship with his estranged parents...so much material for mining.<br/><br/>SIX FEET UNDER was a show that had a couple of gay characters, but it really wasn't a show about being gay. It was more about a family navigating through life, learning, loving, etc. QUEER AS FOLK is also a show about human beings dealing with problems, relationships, searching for love, which of course is so much more difficult than searching for casual fun sex. I don't believe it's a show about \"being gay\" either, but rather a show about gay people. I love its refusal to censor or tone anything down. I love the characters. I love the brave actors who put everything on the line to make things raw and real.<br/><br/>This show is not for anyone who is in the least closed. If you're not wide open, just stay away from it. You have to be open, accepting and loving and if you are, you'll love this experience.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "6 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "19 October 2010"}, {"title": " Good, but a bit over-dramatic", "content": "As a BIG fan of the UK original, I approached this US remake with a sense of trepidation. Happily, I was proved wrong, even if a couple of the US accents are nigh-on impenetrable compared to the far simpler UK accents. Even with the plethora of US shows on our screens, I struggle occasionally. But I digress.<br/><br/>Having so far only seen the first three seasons of the US show, I can't comment on it in its entirety, but what I have seen has been enjoyable, if not quite as intense as the original - some of the plots that were nice and tight in the UK version seem a little strung out in this version. But I guess that's to be expected when you transform a short drama into something closer to a soap opera. And some scenes in the US version struggle against the UK original (Justin's confrontation with his teacher pales when held up to the original scene with Nathan and his teacher). I'm just glad they didn't try to recreate Stuart's coming out speech, that's a classic piece of TV and it seems the US showrunners realised that, not touching it with a barge pole.<br/><br/>Soooooo, overall, a good show and thoroughly enjoyable, so long as you let yourself go with the flow and don't try too much to compare the two. And the US version certainly had a few standout comedy moments - the giant adult toy fight in season one, the scene where the committee visits the two lesbians to discuss Brians' award for saving Justin from a homophobic attack and interrupts an intimate moment, later finding an 'aid' under the sofa cushion. Some very entertaining moments. And, of course, the PFLAG mum is just all kinds of awesome!

The story is pretty darn true-to-life, particularly for any gay man who immerses himself in current gay culture. The bars, the baths, the casual sex, and the boy hopping are all real aspects of queer life in every big town I've been in. The shallowness of these guys' conquests and prospects is very close to the truth. I think it's really brave for the filmmakers to make these characters flawed, sometimes unlikeable and frustrating. Gay folks are all of these things. I prefer this style of storytelling to making gay folks into either irreproachable saints or scum of the earth. Gay single life ain't easy, folks. It's filled with compromises, false hopes and stupid decisions. Just like real life. I can't say I \"relate\" to these guys (I'm just an old married guy who hasn't been to a bar to cruise for almost 20 years).

Although I never bothered to watch the British series, I'm sure it was nowhere near the brilliance of the American version, thanks in large part to the amazing writing and absolutely breathtaking acting.<br/><br/>Gale Harold and Randy Harrison are my absolute favorites. The two of them play Brian and Justin, respectively, which such compassion that it's hard to imagine either one of them in any other roles. Gale is a master at playing the extremely complex character of the somewhat cynical Brian, and he is drop dead gorgeous. Without a tolerable person playing Brian, I'm sure that the show would fall through almost immediately, but thanks to Gale, the show is made nearly flawless. Randy gives a very real and touching performance as Justin and he's given many various tough performances to convey throughout the series. Hal Sparks was probably the perfect choice for Michael; a character that probably came off as incredibly whiny and somewhat annoying on paper translates to a much more interesting and flawed character thanks to Hal's acting chops. Peter Paige sometimes comes off as annoying with the character of Emmett, but most of the time, he portrays Emmett very well. Scott Lowell couldn't have been a more perfect casting choice, and the same goes for both Sharon Gless and Michelle Clunie. Even the weakest member of the cast, Thea Gill, really isn't all that bad and often gives great performances. Scott Lowell wasn't my favorite at first, but his character, Ted, really grew on me and now I'm absolutely bonkers about him. His performances throughout the show are absolutely amazing. Robert Gant is absolutely spectacular as Ben! I can't imagine a better-looking or better-suited actor for the job!<br/><br/>Season 1: Season one couldn't have been a better start for the characters. Almost immediately, we are thrown into a majority of problems and relationships, and introduced to the very important character of Justin. The pilot is flawless, but the best episode of Season 1 is the finale. It was shocking, it was touching, and it made me cry me eyes out. Season one was just amazing and there's no way that it possibly could have been better. It was perfectly balanced and perfectly paced, and had just the right mix of dark humor, well-crafted sex scenes, incredible acting, and witty and intelligent writing.<br/><br/>Season 2: I liked Season two just as much as I liked season one, which is to say a whole hell of a lot. I maybe even liked it more than season one. There were some more characters, amazing plot lines (like the introduction of Ben, Emmett's stint as Fetch Dickson, the loving character of George, the biker Leda and the role she plays in Melanie and Lindsay's lives), and of course a season finale that was absolutely to die for! I loved all of the developments between Justin and Brian, and the introduction of Ethsn was interesting enough. Not enough Daphne in this season, but so long as we have all of that interesting Brian/Justin drama, I'll be good. The episodes were seriously engaging, and I came to appreciate each of the characters more and in new and different lights. Overall a flawless season, possibly better than the first.<br/><br/>Season 3: Why do people dislike the later seasons so much? Apart from being (sadly) shorter than the first two seasons, season three was surprisingly solid in this viewer's eyes. Hunter was extremely annoying at first, but he quickly grew on me. The Ben/Michael relationship is just as enthralling as ever. Ted/Emmett are amazing together, but the last few episodes spell almost certain doom. I loved how much Brian really came into his own this season and really started to be caring. He tried to follow suit just like Justin told him and stand up for what he believes to be right. The season finale was utter perfection and I couldn't have imagined it any better myself. Everything about the finale just seemed so explosive and yet fitting. Brian/Justin are still by far the best couple on the show, and it was great to see them come back together. I LOVED THIS SEASON! My favorite thing about it though: the best hairstyles to date! Seriously, it seems as if everyone's hairstyle was improved in one way or another.<br/><br/>Season 4: Season four was spectacular in many more ways than one. In the words of the cast themselves, the show has really come into its own many interesting story lines and lots and lots of drama. A death, two proposals, an affair, a wedding, and lots of confrontations of past mistakes are all waiting in Season Four. Emmett's relationship with Boyd the football star is just bizarre. I'm not sure that it's half as good of a story arc as it was in season three, but it still at least makes sense. It's very easy to see Emmett falling for Boyd, so it makes the relationship somewhat believable. The beginning of the season (and the middle) is where it is strongest, and it loses just a bit of steam toward the latter part. Still, season four might just be the best one yet, although it's very difficult to choose. I loved everything about it, and the finale, while not perfect, was really something.<br/><br/>Season 5: The show might not have ended exactly the way I wanted it to (one more episode at the very least could have fixed that), but up until the very end it was simply spectacular. Season five was no exception at all, as it was filled to the brim with arguments, interesting relationships (OMG I LOVE TROY!), amazing scenes, and one final scene that everyone will remember forever. The relationships blossom beautifully and the final few episodes are mind-blowing. I love this show, and even season five was amazing.

Yes, there are gay men who sleep around.  But I don't recall any complaints from any young white heterosexuals who were also portrayed as a bunch of bedhoppers on likeminded primetime sudsers such as Melrose Place.  Believe me, many of us can name a real-life counterpart of every character on QAF.  Well, all but Debbie (Sharon Gless); while many shows have a father-type figure for a bunch of kids (from Happy Days to 90210), I don't know anybody my age (27) who's receiving regular advice from an elder.<br/><br/>I've seen several episodes of the original QAF, and although I'm glad the American version has sprouted original storylines, some of the current characters should have been dropped along the way.  Ted's self-criticism has gotten to the point where I'm ready to slap him. Nobody likes a fuddy-duddy who's always putting himself down and relying on his friends to continually soothe his fragile ego; it's time for Emmett to call him on his attitude. And, sorry ladies, but this is a boy's clubhouse.  Lindsay and Melanie's arcs have been underimagined, contrived and unnecessary, and are, at this point, merely inclusive scraps thrown to our Sapphic sisters.<br/><br/>By writing out these dull characters, we now have more room for Season One's most underdeveloped subplot:  Justin's parents and his tumultuous relationship with them.  I've been dying to see more of how Mom is dealing with her young son's homosexuality and its effect on her marriage.  This unexplored facet of gay life would be more involving than the intermittent appearances of the tweaked out Blake and wimp Ted's struggles with them. To Scott Lowell, who plays Ted:  No offense, cutie.  Of all the primary actors, you're the one I find most physically attractive.  I love it when you pop up in those Payday commercials.  But your character is a mope for no good reason.  Ted has a decent job, friends who love him, a supportive family, and, frankly, a nice body.  What's the problem?  If the meat racks of Babylon get him down, I'm sure there are other places to frequent that cater to other types.<br/><br/>Other QAF aspects that can improve is its sense of place.  I know that the show's filmed in Toronto, but jeez, haven't the producers been to Pennsylvania at least once to check it out?  The show's depictions of Pittsburgh and, say, the PA Turnpike are laughably phony.  Why not just set the show in Toronto if you're not going to put forth the money and effort for some geographical accuracy?<br/><br/>There are, however, many redeeming qualities of this show.  Every actor delivers strong performances, and I appreciate their perceived lack of hesitation while handling their more explicit scenes; there's no sense of quiet unease present during all the sloppy same-gendered smooching.  (I'd have a hard time putting up with kissing a female all day with a camera in my face.)<br/><br/>And all the conventions of the soap opera genre persevere:  love triangles, sudden illness, illicit drama, sex, crime, death, betrayal, jealousy, bitchiness, and an overriding lust for life that truly is universal.

People with misguided notions of informing the world that \"Zoo\" is an atrocity and anyone who likes it is of below average intelligence? That being said, some of them aren't wrong.<br/><br/>The cast:<br/><br/>Billy Burke's character, Mitch, is believable and judging by the discrepancies between the subtitles and his actual lines there might have been some improvising. (Smart move, if you ask me.) Nonso Anozie does wonderful work with what he was given. Did anyone tear him apart for his roles in GoT, Ender's Game, etc.? Didn't think so. Save your \"not their best work\" speech for Kristen Connolly, the journalist. Her impression of a tough career-woman bent on uncovering the truth while carrying the weight of a tragic past is less than convincing and does take you out of the moment pretty often. When Billy Burke's character thanks her for \"saving him\" you don't believe she's done anything to deserve his gratitude, let alone his love.<br/><br/>As for Chloe Tousignant, the Parisian federal agent, played by Nora Arnezeder and Jackson Oz, the American safari guide, played by James Wolk? Both are solid actors portraying semi-solid characters. They have their weaknesses and their shining moments. Jackson's character seems to be based on little else than being the superhero to Abe's sidekick and the son of the scientist who discovered and studied the animals' abnormal behavior. Chloe's character is much more believable, down to the fact that she could afford a safari even on her entry-level type status as a French agent and seems to be her own worst critic. Nora seems to have found a way to connect to her character and bring her to life in spite of the show's writing.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Riddled with holes? Absolutely. Writing that frustrates even the most docile of audience members? Check. You're constantly questioning the characters' motives and whoever was responsible for pacing has a lot of explaining to do. With such an intriguing premise and solid, quality acting there is absolutely no excuse for the odd jumps and bumps that make you feel as if you're trying to figure out what should already be obvious and have already figured out what shouldn't be obvious at all. It's backwards - and it's less enjoyable when it's backwards.<br/><br/>Other: In some places, it's shot like my high school drama class made a movie for a talent show. Action-packed sequences that could have been intense and terrifying are tepid and laughable. I would rate the digital elements up there with a good B-flick. <br/><br/>All of that being said. I STILL LIKE THE SHOW. People are so critical and their sense of entitlement causes them to look at good works-in-progress and be bored. That's truly a shame, and I hope that \"Zoo\" remains afloat for a second season to give it the chance to grow it deserves. Was it a James Patterson one-off to line some pockets? Probably. But if the network gets serious about it and brings the actors a decent foundation to work with in season 2, \"Zoo\" could easily compete with the more adventure-driven shows of 2016. This show doesn't need to compete with dark, intelligent shows (Scandal, Blacklist) to be a 10 in its own right.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm inclined to believe Scott Rosenberg was the weak link in this project. The thing about actors is most of them become better with time or are weeded out, and the thing about writing is it can always be overhauled.

But when a series gets it so painfully, horribly wrong as this, I just can't get over it and start anemically yelling at the TV again.<br/><br/>\nThe first season was about Commodus. I know very little about the Roman Empire at this point so I couldn't vouch for many of the historical accuracy, except to say that the series is fixated on the old style myth that all gladiatorial bouts were fights to the death.<br/><br/>Gladiatorial bouts were very rarely fights to the death, although I would give some leeway to this period in time, in particular because Commodus is the one fighting the gladiators in the arena and needs to seem invincible.<br/><br/>A whole lot of other minor details are gotten wrong, few of them would be enough to deter from the information or entertainment value, but when it's a constant stream of little things that are either partly or completely wrong or anachronistic, it starts to become pitiful considering this is not an actual TV show, but a highly stylized documentary. There are fictional re-enactments and depictions, but it's still a documentary, and it's somehow worse than an average TV show.<br/><br/>\nThe second season is where it reaches into a time period I know and can whine about properly.<br/><br/>From the very start, the selection of the actors to portray the triumvirs, Caesar, Pompeius, and Crassus, look absolutely nothing like the people they're supposed to depict. That's hardly a big deal in terms of fictional depictions, but it goes beyond that, to a point where Pompey is bald and has a beard, and Crassus has a mop of curly hair. Every single depiction of Pompey has him with a diamond shaped head and hair, and almost no high ranking Roman in this period had facial hair at all. Crassus as well was old and balding, yet is depicted as being basically the same age as Caesar and Pompey.<br/><br/>\nFrom there on, it starts off with a \"history\" of Caesar which is not even remotely close to being accurate. It depicts him as being a \"lowly soldier\" at age 16, of which is not only not true (he had been forcibly appointed Flamen Dialis by Gaius Marius, a position which forbade him from even touching a knife, much less be a soldier), but the fact that he was from a rich, land-owning patrician family meant he absolutely would NOT have been a \"lowly soldier\", no matter if he was poor or not.<br/><br/>\nNext, it begins to show him engaged in a completely non-existent decade-long military career, culminating in him inexplicably taking part in the war against Spartacus, not only a small part, but apparently a LEADING ROLE in commanding at least a legion.<br/><br/>\nIn reality Caesar by this time had only just gotten out of his position as Flamen Dialis and had a brief stint fighting in Asia Minor, which is where he negotiated with King Nicomedes to secure a fleet, sparking rumors that he seduced Nicomedes and allowed the king to have sex with him, something his political opponents would exploit the hell out of later on. <br/><br/>By the time Spartacus's revolt even happened, Caesar was in Rome acting as a legal advocate and making his name in the law courts.<br/><br/>\nINEXPLICABLY given how much this series wants to focus on blood and guts and glory, they leave out a TRUE (or at least historically recorded) story that says more about Caesar than any of the fake, boring stuff they put forth before it.<br/><br/>Caesar was captured by pirates, and taken to their pirate base. There, he used his wit and charisma to befriend the pirates, and they took a liking to him. All the while, he told them that once he was ransomed, he would come back and crucify them all. The pirates all laughed, thinking him joking. Then Caesar was ransomed, and he came back with a small fleet and had all the pirates crucified.<br/><br/>\nFor absolutely no reason at all, this story is not mentioned at all, looking to a very fake depiction of Spartacus's last battle and diving straight into a triumvirate with Curly Crassus and Bearded Pompey. Worse, they fall into the stupid-trap of apparently thinking that there was only one Consul at a time. Every year two Consuls were elected, and this series portrays Caesar as being the only Consul elected for his year.<br/><br/>\nOn top of that, they do a typical spin so bad as to be a lie in the form of the gangs; they depict Caesar as directly utilizing street gangs in Rome to directly assault and intimidate Senators. Not only would that have been insanely illegal and gotten Caesar killed on sight by the Senate (they had previously done exactly this against several other figures, such as the Gracchi or Marcus Drusus), but it implies a serious anachronism towards the Senate.<br/><br/>\nProbably due to its strong fixation on the ineptitude of the Senate in season 1 covering Commodus, it extends the same false belief into this season with Caesar. The Senate, by Caesar's time, was not an inept and mewling bunch that could do nothing. It was a collection of tyrants in its own right, and Caesar's rise was not something inevitable due to the weakness of the Senate. Caesar's rise was one of masterful diplomacy and cunning, specifically because at any given moment had he slipped up, the Senate would have literally had him killed. His popularity with the people and his strong political connections were his only shield against the malevolent threat of the ultraconservative Senate.<br/><br/>\nHere, he's basically just a thug, bullying his way into power while the Senate meekly mewls and stands by.<br/><br/>\nAs well, they constantly use footage from the BBC movie \"Hannibal: Rome's Worst Nightmare\", where they actually used historically accurate style armor, shields, and helmets, so you will occasionally see these realistic looking legionaries, fighting in formation, spliced in with legionaries in the plate-mail and square shields of the mid-Empire fighting one man army without formation.<br/><br/>They also stupidly mispronounce Vercingetorix as \"Versinjetorix\"", "rating": 1, "helpful": "82 out of 95 found this helpful.", "date": "4 August 2018"}, {"title": " They don't fight in formation.", "content": "The fact that a Roman legion is depicted fighting out of formation like a bunch crazy people really bothered me.

I honestly think this should be illegal.<br/><br/>I will not cover all of the historical inaccuracies as many reviews already have, I will only address the massive one in the second season.<br/><br/>For years now there has been this bizarre attempt to \"brownwash\" Cleopatra, despite there being very obvious reasons that she was indeed a Macedonian Greek. Usually revisionists, who almost never know anything about history, start from point A, which is literally that Cleopatra was from Egypt and was the queen of Egypt. Then, when given a history lesson and no real way around it, they claim, well we don't know who her mother was and the Greeks PROBABLY mixed with locals. Then, when educated even more about the incest within the Ptolemaic dynasty, that's when the real insidious players come out and say \"who cares what race Cleopatra was?\". It's truly unbelievable to see this full circle jerk unfold about the race of Cleopatra. Literally the only people who care are people who know absolutely NOTHING about history and buy into her being black or Egyptian simply because she lived there. <br/><br/>Having set that up, not only does this show \"brownwash\" Cleopatra, they completely strip any connection Cleopatra and Ptolemy had with Greece and they are simply referred to as \"Egyptians\". Ptolemy, Cleopatra, and the people in their courts are all portrayed and referred to as Egyptians. The so-called \"professors\" that speak (all of which should be banned from teaching of any kind) in the documentary part of the show all refer to the Ptolemies as \"the Egyptians\" and talk about the long standing relationship that Rome had with.....\"the Egyptians\". Folks, this is the literal equivalent of portraying George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Ronald Regan as Native Americans, and completely disregarding their European roots. <br/><br/>So what is the point of doing this? Why would they completely change history in a so-called documentary? I can't fathom why, it lent zero entertainment value and completely dis-Educated it's audience. The only reason this kind of revisionism passes in America is because of a purposeful attempt to disinterest Americans in real history.

If you think it's boring than I doubt there is any version of this that could make you happy. What made me not like it as much is after watching the first episode where they had history experts on and built up this whole thing complaining about commodus being a untrained loser is the fact that he was only 13 years old at the time! The part is being played by a 28 year old man! It's much harder to blame a 13 year old not being ready to be the king of Rome than it is a 28y/o man.

Her haunting looks enables you to feel a pain that the writers brilliantly hold off revealing until later episodes. * Noni Hazlehurst--Elizabeth Bligh-- she is a character I love to hate and hate to love. I love how the writers do not allow you to put her into any fixed category. She is such a fine actor you never know where she is going to take you but you willingly follow her there because she is that fantastic. * Brett Climo-- George Bligh--what I enjoy about his role as patriarch is that he is present without being overwhelming. I can't wait until they cut him loose. * Craig Hall--Jack Duncan--he, like George Bligh's character, have suggestions of depth, Duncan's role is becoming more fleshed out and I like where it is heading. * David Berry--James Bligh--his anguish, he wears on his sleeve, but it seems the writers have pulled him back a bit, which is welcome. * Abby Earl--Anna Bligh--she, to me, is the most refreshing character.

It's hard to say too much without spoilers since practically everyone starts out with a secret sorrow, a clandestine romance, a wartime trauma they don't care to talk about, a stigmatized sex pref, an unacknowledged illegitimate child or somebody's else's child they're raising as their own, which can only be revealed in the fullness of time.... Suffice it to say that the first two seasons focus mainly on the efforts of the Bligh family matriarch to prevent any of her brood from marrying beneath them or forming some other unsuitable attachment, despite the abundance of tempting distractions (a hunky Italian farmboy, a gorgeous blond nurse with a murky past) and the deficiencies of the eligible candidates (snobbish, vindictive playboy, deceased wife's treacherous sister).<br/><br/>We're total suckers for the shameless cliffhangers and out-of-left-field plot twists. The first-rate cast plays it straight for the most part; there are a few stock Aussie characters--including a salt-of-the-earth farmer who declaims \"bush ballads\" about bandicoots and billabongs--but nothing too clich\u00e9d or kitschy.

But the Soap Operas were nearly always written by men and were filled with fantasies of office romance, flirtatious secretaries, promiscuity, and adultery. As suspicious housewives greeted their husbands thinking I know what you did at the office today. I am sure the Soap Operas were responsible for the breakup of more than a few marriages.

With a strong initial cast including the silent, sexy Mr Mayer (George Irving), nurses Jasmine (Angela Griffin) and Julie (Nicola Stephenson), and doctors Nick (Michael French), Victoria (Lisa Faulkner) and Kirstie (Dawn McDaniel), it had a lot of life and some good story lines. Then Jasmine was stabbed, Kirstie was involved in drugs, and Victoria was killed by a resentful parent of a patient who died in her care.<br/><br/>Hunky consultant Mike Barratt (Clive Mantle) who had been in 'Casualty', also joined Holby early on, and the sparring between him and Meyer was memorable (especially loved a Christmas episode where it snowed right on cue and we even got a 'ho ho ho' from Meyer). Later consultants have had their fair share of problems - Ric (Hugh Quarshie), still in the programme, has had drug and gambling addictions; Alistair (Dominic Jephcott) had a wife in IVF treatment (Janice, played by Siobhan Redmond, was a doctor in the children's ward), an affair with a nurse (Chrissie, played by Tina Hobley), and eventually came back after a year's gap to be killed in the recent Christmas episode; Tom (Denis Lawson) was a drunk; Tash (Thusita Jayasundera), was a mixed-up lesbian, and so on, and so on.<br/><br/>Tragedy struck the nurses, too. Lovely Liam (Adrian Lewis Morgan) was crippled after falling from a balcony - in a terrible twist of fate, Laura Sadler, who played Sandy, died in real life in similar circumstances when still in her early twenties. Steve (Peter de Jersey)and Ben (David Paisley) were killed off in a car crash, but not until Ben had a hard time coming out to his parents. Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White) suffered when her dad was killed in euthanasia by his new wife, and the prolific Chrissie miscarried a baby - handy since she wasn't sure who the dad was.<br/><br/>All this, and plenty of sexual shenanigans, before we even consider what the patients have gone through before they get to the hospital wards. The episodes have been consistently well-written and tightly directed, and with the current cast including talent such as Art Malik as Zubin (has just had an affair with Ric's nurse daughter Jess), and Sharon Maughan as Chrissie's mother Tricia, it seems that life in the fictional world of recuperation is going to move along just fine.", "rating": null, "helpful": "6 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "12 January 2005"}, {"title": " Series 4 shows that Holby isn't as bad as they say", "content": "As all the other comments have been made about only Series 1 and 2 and Holby is now near the end of its 4th series, I need to renew them.

Superficially things look like a real hospital, though I've never figured out why the outdoors scenes shot outside the hospital all seem to occur at night. The acting and characterisation is also very good.<br/><br/>However script wise this show trots out every ancient hospital drama clich\u00e9 and familiar plotline ever known. Out of the small cast, four characters who work in the hospital have ended up patients in their own wards, the staff spend inordinate amounts of time dealing with patients' personal problems which all seem to come out only on their admission to hospital but which are all conveniently resolved within the hour; and each week there's an actor famously dropped from \"Family Affairs\", a host of \"The Bill\" guest stars, and former \"Coronation Street\" and \"EastEnders\" regulars in for good measure.<br/><br/>Actually I have enjoyed some of the episodes I've seen (I've only seen seasons 1 and 2) but even the best episodes contain ridiculous plot contrivances that even the most naive lay-person must find difficult to swallow.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SEASON TWO SPOILERS<br/><br/>The episode where Nick Jordan's hearing is held was particularly bad.

Given the grave situation occurring at the hospital concerning the performance of three key staff members, you'd have thought that _everyone_ there would be on their toes and following every rule to the letter that day.<br/><br/>\nThe last episode of season two was certainly dramatic, but how come no one had a mobile phone?

In a sense, it's the perfect show for our troubled times - at the height of an economic recession, with all these disasters occurring over the past few years, never has apathy and pessimism seemed so natural. As such, the show really taps into a broken-down, bitter attitude, using the LA wasteland as its source of inspiration...but it remains strangely optimistic because of the relationships between its cast members, whose characters struggle with their awful catering job but, at the end of the day, stick by each other. There's a sense of family amongst these broken-down rejects, and that's why we love watching their weekly miseries.<br/><br/>Adam Scott (a seriously underrated actor) is the \"straight man\" for the show - he enters season one as Henry, a new employee of Party Down Catering. He's a failed actor out of Hollywood who has finally accepted that he's too old and past his prime to ever achieve his dreams of becoming a star, so he has resorted to bartending for the company. Scott is wonderful at playing apathetic, and gives some of the best facial expression reactions I've seen in comedy. I'm used to seeing him as the meaner or wackier characters in titles like \"Step Brothers\" or \"Eastbound and Down,\" but here he plays a very empathetic and human character, and is really the heart of the show.<br/><br/>Lizzy Caplan is the other relatively normal character in the show. She plays Casey, a stand-up comic treading water. As the season progresses, she becomes romantically involved with Henry, who is essentially her (and our) anchor amidst all the other crazy and eccentric people they encounter.<br/><br/>Ron Donald (Ken Marino) is the manager for Party Down, but the show avoids giving us the clich\u00e9d mean boss: he is painfully nice and sincere, with a perfectly goofy Brendan Fraser-style haircut that looks like someone just evened off the top rather lazily. Toward the end of season one he has a bit of a relapse with liquor and by season two his hair has grown out and he's smoking pot and drinking all day and lamenting his failed love life.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast consists of geeky Roman (Martin Starr), an aspiring elitist sci-fi writer whose writing actually rather sucks; Kyle (Ryan Hansen), a vain pretty-boy with another ridiculous haircut; and Constance (Jane Lynch), who exited season one to join the cast of \"Glee\" and was replaced in S2 by Lydia, a character played by Megan Mullally, who, it must be said, actually did a pretty good job filling in the void.<br/><br/>News spread yesterday that \"Party Down\" was canceled after the season two finale because it barely nabbed 700,000 viewers. Starz mishandled this show from day one, from not securing actors' contracts correctly (Adam Scott, unsure of whether the show would be renewed months ago, joined \"Parks and Recreation\" instead, and Ryan Hansen was also rumored to be moving on) to not really advertising it very much -- and then relying solely on viewing numbers instead of Netflix streams or illegal downloads. (Because they were dumb enough to NOT provide legal downloads on iTunes, which probably would have worked really well for them.) I've heard a lot of positive word-of-mouth lately, with everyone I talk to streaming it on Netflix's website. I don't know a single person who even subscribes to Starz. I'd say 700k views for a season finale on a premium channel that no one watches is pretty good! But I'm actually kinda glad that they went out on a good note rather than running the show into the ground. They provided two very consistent seasons, and with Adam Scott's definite departure from the show, it really just wouldn't have been the same. Hopefully the show will pick up some more word-of-mouth and become a cult hit on DVD, and Starz will do some kind of special a couple years down the road (like Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant did with the British \"Office\") - then the full cast could return. Even though I'm glad the show didn't outstay its welcome, I liked these characters enough to be interested in where they'd be at in a few years. <br/><br/>\"Party Down\" is destined to be one of those titles you'll see on critics' \"canceled-too-soon\" lists over the next few years, right up there with \"Arrested Development\" and \"Freaks and Geeks.\" It was a pleasure to watch every week, oddly reassuring in its pessimism, finding humour in the strengths of likable and empathetic characters, even when they were suffering through some pretty rough times. I feel like much truly great comedy finds the truths in common human weakness, causing us to laugh at misfortunes that we can relate to, and \"Party Down\" excelled at doing so.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "80 out of 88 found this helpful.", "date": "1 July 2010"}, {"title": " TV's Best Kept Sevret", "content": "Where to even begin.

How wrong was I. Season one is way better than most of the current comedy shows on TVs. Party Down is about a group of wannabe-Hollywood-artists whose careers didn't go as well as they hoped, so they've started to work in the titular catering company, and every episode is set at a different party, like for example a Sweet 16 of a spoiled girl or Senior Singles seminar. <br/><br/>The cast of the show is awesome. From the Veronica Mars alums (Ken Marino, Ryan Hansen) to other familiar faces (Martin Starr-\"Freaks and Geeks\" and Lizzy Caplan-\"Cloverfield\") etc. everyone fits in they're role perfectly and delivers the jokes flawlessly. Special praise in my opinion goes to Adam Scott, who plays Henry, and Jane Lynch, who plays Constance. Henry's recognizability due to the fact that he played in a beer commercial and the great catch-phrase that came along with it are the cause of many laughs throughout the season. Jane Lynch on the other hand is great as an oddball in the group, the arguments that she has with the groups \"hardcore sci-fi veteran\" Roman are also very hilarious. But those characters are not the only ones who bring laughter to the viewer, the guest stars are also great, from the foul-mouthed JK Simmons, whose basically JJ Jameson with safety off, to Veronica Mars herself- Kristen Bell as an strict catering team leader, they make every episode memorable.<br/><br/>The writing is also top-notch, dialogues are awesome and the situations that the main characters find themselves in every episode, which to say always end in failure, are clever and hilarious. The only downside to this show that I could find is the mandatory in these types of shows (see Jim and Pam, Ross and Rachel, JD and Elliot) \"will they or won't they\" storyline with two of the main characters- played by Scott and Caplan. The banters between the two are great, but in the end, the relationship feels kind of forced and unneeded.

Shows such as 'Arrested Development' and 'Freaks and Geeks.' 'Party Down' is another one of those shows. So smart, funny, innovative, yet, gets yanked off the air because of low ratings. Sad.<br/><br/>'Party Down' revolves around a party-catering company. The structure of the show is very simple yet effective. Each episode takes place at a certain event with certain types of people. This gives each eccentric character a chance to interact with all of the party guests in so many awkward, unusual, and flat-out hilarious ways. <br/><br/>A major theme of 'Party Down' is young people trying to have breakthroughs and make it into the film industry. They want so badly to become noticed, yet, they work for others every week and have no satisfaction. This is one of the many genius pathos that drive this very thoughtful comedy.<br/><br/>As a whole, 'Party Down,' obviously, was very underrated. But something very underrated is the cast of the show. 'Party Down' has one of the very best comedic ensembles I've seen on TV. The main character is Henry, played by Adam Scott. Henry is a very hopeless and apathetic actor who made it somewhat big with a famous catch-phrase on a beer commercial. Now, though, he can't seem to find his breakthrough, so to get by, he works for the Party Down company as a bartender, but has no interest in it at all. Adam Scott is one of the very best young and comedic actors around. He plays the part very subtle and small, making the character really speak to us. He plays the 'straight-man' to all of the eccentric characters, yet he has this relaxed humor that doesn't come off as over-the-top. Scott's performance reminds me a lot of Jason Batmane's in 'Arrested Development.'<br/><br/>The supporting characters here are all so interesting and wonderfully weird. There's Casey, a character who's very similar to Henry. She's a comedian trying to strike it big and Lizzy Caplan plays the role very subtle but has a biting delivery as well. Her and Scott's chemistry is something so sweet and honest to watch. Ken Marino plays Ron, a character who's so cringe-worthy but yet so addictive and funny. Ron is the company's leader who we learn used to be into drugs. He becomes clean, and now parades around his coworkers making sure they know just how much of a good person he is. Ron is a good person, but he's so painfully honest and does everything for the best of his team, which takes the character into some hilarious situations. There's Roman played by Martin Starr. Roman is a character who reminds me of Dwight Schrute from 'The Office.' He's very nerdy, intense, but yet kind of driven. Roman is a science-fiction screenwriter hoping to get noticed. He's very eccentric and makes for some very funny moments. There's Kyle, played by Ryan Hansen. Kyle is your typical Hollywood pretty boy actor. An actor who may become famous just because of his long blonde hair and good looks. He thinks he has talent, but is so oblivious to what he really is. Then lastly there's Jane Lynch as Constance and Megan Mullally as Lydia. Both of these actresses and characters are very similar. They are very big comedic performances that offer some scene-stealing moments. These characters are the oldest ones of the group, and play as each young person's mentor. These actresses are obviously two hilarious and very talented women, and both of these characters are so wonderfully weird.<br/><br/>'Party Down' has a very quiet, subtle, and smart sense of humor. Its very character-driven, which is something you don't get quiet often. The situations and pathos in each episode are very true and seem so real. 'Party Down' is also filmed in a very interesting way for a comedy as well. Its basically a hand-held camera, but the filming techniques here simple and effective. The directors let each scene roll in a relaxed way so each actor/actress can really let loose with their lines and get really creative with their characters. <br/><br/>The complete series, which consists of only 20 episodes, is available on Netflix.

That's the only way to describe Season 3. The first 2 Seasons were pretty good and I looked forward to a 3rd Season but by the end of Season 3 Episode 1, you knew it was going to be a Hot Mess. Plot holes you could drive a truck through. Bad guy turns good- Phil. Because he killed a living human being he's had a consciousness change because he was only supposed to kill the Risen. Suddenly he wanes for life and family and wants to become their protector so he can live out a life with his family. Good guy turns bad-Owen. So shell shocked by the death of his parents-both from cancer and now his sister is dying from it he basically kidnaps Kate, with the help of others, so she can give the sister a blood transfusion because if she beat cancer it certainly must be in her blood. Owen said he would let her go once she transfused the sister without thinking that the others would want to profit from her being alive years after she died. Not once did he think that thy were all on different pages, especially when the one guy started taking lots of pictures of Kate. She gets away and then the plot line is completely dropped. I can't recall if she even told the others what happened to her as a warning. Kate hooks up with Phil who wants to live forever and manages to convince her he's changed. Meanwhile Charlie and Kristie are trying to be normal when Kristie discovers, after being dead for over a decade -she's pregnant and the father is probably Pete, the man that murdered her. WOW! Has this plot gone over the rainbow. In some weird rite of retribution, Pete in his wheelchair falls down a flight of stairs, dies, than he comes back to life- normal but is eventually killed by his younger brother Chris. I think it would have been fitting for him to stay in that chair the rest of his life. James, who has been with his daughter at his parents' home is basically flipping out, his Dad takes him out for a beer. While at the restaurant he slips, hits his head, apparently dies and comes back as a Risen hit man. James returns to the table; Dad doesn't notice the trickle of blood out his ear. He whacked his head hard enough to kill him yet there was no bruise? Back to Yoorana he's is now hunting the others under the flag of helping them and he HOOKS UP with William who says everyone has to return to their previous state-DEAD. It's not obvious that James and Wm are on the same team because of all the conflict and fighting between them to throw viewers off. The remainder of Wm's role in the series is ridiculous and is just a time filler. His story line meeting the Dr. and her friends adds nothing to the episode.<br/><br/>The 1st episode introduces 2 new Risen people. A 15 years of girl and an Asian man. I could see no reason for this storyline except as a filler for a poorly written script. Their stories served no purpose.<br/><br/>One can't forget Noregard . In comes the owner of the company. After the private investigator hunts down Charlie and Kirstie, he offers them sanctuary in Sweden and protection as long as they make themselves available for testing. Kristie wants to take the guy up on his offer but Charlie's a no go. Interesting this guy, Sam, is ready to whisk them both or all of them away to Sweden and never mentioned the barrier that kept them bound. He didn't seem to be concerned that high altitudes might turn them into dust in midair. In fact, with the exception of Kate trying the boundary in episode 1, it was never mentioned again when it was an integral part of the series. Noregard storyline is abruptly dropped.<br/><br/>There are no real surprises and much disappointment. The fact that James &amp; Wm were plotting to get everyone in one place and feed them a meal loaded with poison became obvious when the 2 of them began doing things that their characters hadn't done before. Most disappointing was the explanation that the terrible natural events that were happening in the world was caused by 7 people returning from the dead. These people destroyed the entire balance of the planet? HOW LAME! All walk into a burning forest to right nature, I guess. I know that was for effects, but it fell flat. No drama. At the end of it I felt cheated. Fortunately, I binged it in a few hours. What a sad and sorry way to end a series that had potential but for lazy writing and bad acting on the part of several characters. You like to leave the audience feeling connected or sad that a character died but here-I was glad they are died because the writers gave them no purpose, no essence.

However I was wrong, it's not a remake, and it's not a zombie series. It's takes a different angle on the theme from \"Les Revenants\" which is refreshing and clever.

They are not zombies but healthy and if they had diseases due to which they died, they don't have it anymore. A boy watching it happen, calls the police. When policeman arrives in cemetery, seeing one of them is injured, he calls the doctor, thinking this whole thing might be a part of some dare or a drunken incident. However, as the doctor and policeman realizes the truth, they start helping and protecting the 'risen'. The risen are healthy but have some limitations which makes the story more interesting.<br/><br/>I started watching it because people writing reviews here, were in the awe of this series. Season 1 episode 1 was interesting, but as the story progresses, I found it's pace a bit slow for my taste. Remembering pieces bit by bit, and unraveling mysteries of their past is good but doesn't lead to much places. However, last episode picked up the pace, and started opening the pieces of how these people might have come back. And the last sentence of season 1 finale hooked me up so much that I started season 2 right away. Season 2 has a better pace then season 1 and doesn't shy away from major questions. However, it also generates more questions which you might get answers to, if it is renewed for season 3. I watched a similar series 'Resurrection' which had the same scenario but they never dwelled on the why/how of it. I liked this series better because they are approaching that question and making it the center premise of this series.<br/><br/>Besides that I liked the acting, all characters were believable. There were many coincidences, but in a small town there can be, so I don't mind them a lot.

I would get done with each series and think to myself, \"oh my dear lord did I seriously just watch 5 freaking hours of TV?\" What I loved so much about this show is the constant wondering if something was really happening or if it is imagined. Many times you would see Tommy destroying a room in anger or doing something terrible or drinking when he had committed to sobriety only to find out that he was just dreaming or having a flash of the way things could have been. That is reality for many people, and I for one am someone who often lives much too deeply in the past and forever feel guilt or sadness for things I will never be able to change, and I think that is why I connected so much to this show. Grief and sadness and resentment and anger are true in life even without such tragedies as 09/11 and some deal with it and some just can't or don't. The interesting thing to think about is, wouldn't it be AWESOME to be able to communicate with those people that you have left behind? To be able to have conversations with your dead cousin who was your best friend?

Ladder 62 is the crew that the show centres on, and it features, among others, Denis Leary as Tommy Gavin, the main character, whom has, among other things, a drinking problem, a drug problem (at times), a marriage that has fallen apart, and survivor's guilt which resulted from his cousin's (another firefighter) death on 9/11.<br/><br/>The show starts off as somewhat of an ensemble show, although the focus starts to narrow as the seasons wear on. It mainly consists of watching these firefighters deal with their issues, grief, guilt, anger, substance abuse and relationship problems, with some on the job focus as well (a fire scene or two is present in most, but not all, episodes).<br/><br/>The show also features a healthy amount of comedy, which usually consists of antic between the \"brothers\" in the firehouse, much of it centring around practical jokes and conversations about things like discoloured penises and sexual orientation. Another source of laughs is Tommy's absolute inability to tell the truth with any consistency, and watching him stumble trying to lie his way out of the myriad of situations he finds himself on, often due to either his drinking problem or his rampant infidelity (or both).<br/><br/>The characters other than Tommy Gavin are mostly fellow firefighters, his wife Janet, and his myriad of mistresses, including a long term one who also doubles as his biggest critic, apart from his Janet. Speaking of his Janet, she at first appears to be the utter antithesis of Tommy, but then, as the show moves forward, you come to realize that she is no better, and in some ways is much worse, although she acts as though this is not so, and is adept at playing the victim role and projecting onto Tommy her personal demons. The two of them and their never ending struggles provide a main thread of the story, and, luckily, their every changing relationship and dynamic works well, as it needed to in order to maintain viewer interest.<br/><br/>The other firefighters alluded to earlier include, among others, his best friend Kenneth Shea (who they refer to as Lou), a stocky middle aged firefighter with a good heart and nice disposition who has some inner turmoil he deals with in ways he'd just as soon not have the guys know about; Franco Rivera, the hunky Puerto Rican player, Sean Garrity, the affable and somewhat dumb goof, Mike Silletti, the 'probie' (probationary firefighter); also a bit dumb and struggling with his sexuality, and later addition, Bart (Shawn), the house's first black firefighter and someone whom becomes tied to Tommy in a personal way as the series progresses.<br/><br/>Filling out the cast are Tommy and Janet's four children (Colleen, Connor, Kate and the baby), his brother Johnny, the ghost of his deceased firefighter cousin Jimmy (who he sees and converses with on a regular basis), Jimmy's widow, Sheila, his cousin Mick, a priest and his AA sponsor, Tommy's uncle Ted, his father, sister Maggie, and a few other family members. There are also characters who come and go, many of whom end up being love interests/flings for the guys (particularly Tommy and Franco).<br/><br/>As I alluded to earlier, Tommy regularly converses with his deceased cousin Jimmy, as well as a few other ghosts as the series progresses. This, in part at least, causes Tommy to wonder about the possibility of an afterlife, as well as the existence (or non) of a god. Raised Catholic, he struggles with belief throughout the series, seeming to alternate between belief, non belief, and contempt, depending on events. Religion is also an area of note for a few other characters in the show. The treatment of religion in the show seems to be pretty accurate, and religion provides the backdrop for a few of the more memorable scenes in the series, involving Tommy and his priest cousin, but I won't give anything away here.<br/><br/>As an atheist, I did not find the religious aspect to be at all annoying, as it is not overly prominent, and there is certainly no proselytizing (nor would you expect there to be, seeing as how Leary, the main character, creator and writer, is an atheist). It merely shows that religion is a part of the characters' lives, and a prominent one at times (and not a consideration at all at others).<br/><br/>The fire scenes are actually the least gripping aspect of the show, in my view. They're wholly uninteresting, not very unpredictable, not all that exciting, and visually bland, as they are (of course) dark and smoky, and therefore they come with reduced visibility (understandable, certainly, but a bit annoying at times). They are not a prominent aspect of this show in the least, and I usually find myself slightly disappointed when that fire bell rings. I'd much rather them continue the conversation they were having, especially the really intense or funny ones (both of which there are a lot of).<br/><br/>The acting is almost uniformly great. The writing is mostly good, often great, occasionally magnificent, and sometimes poor/predictable/clich\u00e9d/replete with plot holes. It's fairly consistent but sometimes gets lost and takes an episode or two to find its way. I can honestly say that I haven't truly hated any single episodes, and I have loved the majority of them. I have come to genuinely care about almost everyone on the show, and quite often I have come around from dislike to like, hate to love, even multiple times with the same character.<br/><br/>The show is an excellent mix of comedy and drama that deals with infidelity, substance abuse, imperfect parents and children, brotherhood, friendship, family, dysfunction, bravery, fear, cowardice, religion and the struggle with belief, lust, love, lies and lace. Not to mention discoloured penises and lesbians.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Rescue Me.<br/><br/>http://magx01.blogspot.com/", "rating": 8, "helpful": "5 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "23 July 2010"}]}, "/title/tt0112167/": {"title": "Sliders", "reviews": [{"title": " A good show destroyed by the network", "content": "When Slider's debuted I was in heaven, OK the F/X weren't Hollywood grand but they did what they could with what they had, the cast was great and the story was engaging.

I saw the first several episodes of Season One, then got busy and only saw a few episodes of Season Two, and then when one of the \"returning villains\" first reared their head, I completely tuned out the show.<br/><br/>The first couple of seasons were about parallel Earths, and the main characters visiting the such.

The initial premise was exciting, namely that parallel worlds existed and could be accessed through a 'gateway' created by boy genius Quinn Mallory. In each Universe differences might be slight or substantial depending on the historical events that had taken place prior to that current time.<br/><br/>As with any show, a decent plot on its own cannot be carried without great character portrayal. I thought the four original cast of actors were brilliant - Jerry O'Connell, Sabrina Lloyd, Cleavant Derricks, John Rhys-Davies (The commanding presence he had in this was mesmerising. When the show forced him away there was a gaping hole in the show's believability that ultimately was not filled). Unsurprisingly, when these actors were separated by circumstances of which I am not completely clear (so I wouldn't like to pass too much judgement), the credibility of the show was lost into oblivion.<br/><br/>However, whilst the cast remained intact, the writers (Tracy Torme and Robert K Weiss) ever inventive and the show true to its initial premise this programme was a joy to watch. My most memorable moments of the series include one during post traumatic slide syndrome where we discover that they might have actually finally returned home - but are mislead by the squeaking gate (which had been repaired since they had been away), the arguments between Arturo and Rembrandt and the latter's singing performances.

No limit to the number of possible stories.<br/><br/>What wasn't terrific is the clich\u00e9 of what happened once the Sliders got there--even in the generally heralded Season 1.<br/><br/>A typical episode: The Sliders land on some new world. Initially things don't look so bad to them. But soon they find out that The World Isn't That Great After All. They end up running afoul of some Bad Guys (seems that they just can't stop meeting up with Bad Guys), who want them killed. So they escape, flee, and manage to slide out of there Just In Time before they're killed. It seems like the last third of nearly every episode is about the Sliders Chased By The Bad Guys. Evidently with very few exceptions, the only way to motivate the Sliders to slide again was to have them Chased By Bad Guys.<br/><br/>Why can't the Sliders land someplace where they're not in any physical danger, but they just are appalled by the customs or the society or something there? Why can't there be alternate worlds which are truly so nice and tempting that the Sliders are tempted to stay there, rather than return home to their friends and families? And have to make a difficult choice between love of their families on Earth Prime vs. a life in paradise on Paradise-Earth? The writers had an opportunity to do that with the Season 1 episode \"Luck of the Draw.\" The episode would have been fine if Wade and Rembrandt each fell in love with a lottery winner, and tried to save the two winners before they were killed. It wasn't necessary to put Wade and Rembrandt in physical danger themselves. Doing so just added to the feeling that all episodes had to end with The Sliders Escaping From Mortal Danger.<br/><br/>Other sci-fi series--Star Trek included--showed more creativity here. Besides all the episodes where Our Heroes Are In Mortal Danger, there were plenty of other episodes where Our Heroes had important decisions to make or an important problem to solve, or they tried to interact with local inhabitants and failed, or they were tempted to stay there and decided not to, etc. But all this seems beyond the reach of Sliders' writers.", "rating": 5, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "6 April 2011"}, {"title": " i love sliders, one of the best underrated shows ever!!!", "content": "Sliders is one of my favorite science fiction shows of all time even in my childhood.

FOX network took creative control away from the creator/show-runner Tracy Torm\u00e9 due to creative differences and being replaced with the executive producer David Peckinpah as the show runner, he is partially responsible for the series jumping-the-shark and the drop in quality. first problem i notice was the change in tone, it's more going for action packed season that falls between serious and silly at the same time, Quinn Mallory's personality changes so frequently and dramatically in this season. from a likable misfit to a cold self-centered jerk, helping other people is more important then he's friends which is so out-of-character for him. Wade also changed a bit, she's a little preachier, but has really great subtle moments. Rembrandt and Arturo are the only ones that are consistent with their personalities. <br/><br/>first couple episodes are as good as the first two seasons, but then there are the painful \"monster/movie rip-offs of the week\" episodes. few of the movie rip-off episodes are watchable despite the poor writing, but unfortunately most of them are predictable, boring and borderline terrible, even by sliders standers. due to decline in quality John-Rhys Davis had enough and wanted the leave half-way through season 3. his departure (killed-off) was one of the saddest moments in television history for the original cast members and the fans. then we are introduce to Kari Wuhrer as Maggie Beckett replacing John-Rhys Davis for the second half of third season. Wuhrer's character at first was terrible replacement for Arturo, her wooden acting and her bitchy military personality always irritate me. the fact she become Quinn new love interest, always tags along with him, pushing Wade a side with Rembrandt feels just wrong on so many levels. Kari Wuhrer was clearly in the show to attract younger-male viewers (boost the ratings) but thankfully by season 4 she's more likable and fleshed-out character. i feel bad for Sabrina Lloyd who left the series after season 3 with a bad taste, because of the idiotic decision from the producer and not getting along with Kari Wuhrer's ego. <br/><br/>since FOX practically ruined the series, they give it to the \"sci-fi channel\" for the last two seasons. <br/><br/>'Season 4' is an improvement in terms of writing and quality after the jumbled mess of season 3. it's faithful to the original concept, but darker and serious then the previous seasons and not as great as first two seasons but overall a good season. it involves \"The Kromaggs\" from season 2 as the main villains of season 4. Jerry O'Connell's brother Charlie O'Connell join the cast as Quinn's lost brother Collin Mallory. Collin is very enjoyable character for the most part. with the issues i addressed, i love this series so much, and i collected all four seasons of sliders. <br/><br/>the reason i said all four is because that speck so-called 'season 5' doesn't exist to me, not only the worst season but complete chore to sit-through. with nothing left but a shadow of it's former self. <br/><br/>without Jerry O'Connell there is no point continuing the series. jerry and his brother left the series, after a dispute with the network (sci-fi channel) but a fifth season was made without them anyway. almost the entire original cast gone, smaller budget then previous seasons, re-using the same location, poorly-written episodes and no closure. how sad when a series started out so great and promising and ended up derailed by idiots.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "6 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "15 September 2015"}, {"title": " Need closure", "content": "I remember the day i saw the first episode of sliders and fell in love with the series.

A teen show like Dawson's Creek, or Buffy for that matter (I still can't understand why so many people like it -- ick), cannot hold a candle to Roswell.

I love the show so much that even I, a poor pharmacology grad student, made an effort to tape reruns of Season 1, had the foresight to tape Season 3 (even if it was sub-par for the show), and after the Space station here in Canada stopped the reruns, paid way too much for Season 2 on VCD, just so I can watch it whenever I want, whenever the current lineup on TV gets me down.

It's not groundbreaking or brilliant, but it's a very nicely entertaining show with a heart.<br/><br/>While a little bit silly sometimes when it comes to both, relationship and sci-fi-elements, the strength of the show definitely lies in the more grounded relationship-story lines which dominated the show in its first season. Back in the first season, the writers also included a nice storyarc that was very well executed in terms of just revealing a little bit, but enough to make it interesting and suspenseful. (the whole Nasedo/FBI-storyarc) Unfortunately the show was always a show that was on the bubble and since the network wanted the show to be more successful than it was, they insisted on extending the fantasy/sci-fi/action-elements of the show, since \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\" were a huge success for them back then. While \"Buffy\" and \"Angel\" are definitely superior to \"Roswell\" and brilliant (although not with every single episode), that's what ultimately led to \"Roswell\"'s demise since that simply wasn't the show that \"Roswell\" was and since the writers didn't really succeed at making the sci-fi-elements post season one work. Most of the time, the sci-fi-elements were a huge weakness of the show. Sometimes very silly and not really thought through, they hurt the show more than they helped her. Obviously you can still watch the show and enjoy the sci-fi-elements in season two and three, but only if you switch your brain off and don't think about them.<br/><br/>The characters on the show and their relationships to each other are the heart of the show. At developing these characters and letting them grow over a couple of seasons, the writers of \"Roswell\" succeeded and were even better than writers of shows that air these days.<br/><br/>The cast of the show is topnotch. Behr and Appelby deliver stellar performances as the star-crossed couple Max and Liz which are the center of the show. The real stars however can be found in the supporting cast. Majandra Delfino delivers wit and beauty in her part as Liz's best friend Maria De Luca, but is still capable to add emotional depth to her character. Brendan Fehr makes Michael to the most interesting and most vulnerable character of the show, while Katherine Heigl plays the sympathetic and spoiled princess among the group.

Valenti, whom is supposed to be the bad but instead is fun and great. Kyle, whom is hilarious but it was first by the episode when he and Max were drunk that got me to like him. Max, because he is the guy in my dreams. Good-looking, blue-eyed, shy, quiet, thoughtful and wise - and most of all - sexy to women. Michael, because he is the ordinary rebel who actually is very intelligent and kind in his gold heart, but is rebel because of his parent situation. He feels lost in his world. Isabel, because she is always lovely and says smart lines and is very intelligent. Maria, who is the one who helps whoever whenever needs to be. Liz, who is very faithful and believes the best of other people. Alex, who is the ordinary nerd guy who falls in love with Isabel, very different his personality.<br/><br/>In some way I am more drawn to this than Buffy, The X files and other science fiction TV shows, as this finished after only three seasons. Smart done by the producers, I think, because it would have lost its charm after the third season. And it is the more reason to keep this in mind, when everything has just been great. And the more reason to re watch the three seasons when you haven't something to do or when it is bad TV shows airing on TV... Just re watch this and enjoy your memories.. I will for sure never be tired of this TV show.<br/><br/>Evertything starts with Liz being shot. Max heals her with his alien power, but after that their lives, and the others's, change forever. Things went weird. The secret has to be told. And so starts the hunt for the truth...<br/><br/>This is not too much romance. Not either too much science fiction. It is just an ordinary TV show, except from the fact that it is about three aliens and three humans in the center. They are looking for the truth of the three aliens's past and origin - why they came to Earth and how they can come back there. But before they are able to do, they fall in love with each other. Max in Liz, Michael in Maria and Alex in Isabel. They have to handle everyday troubles - love troubles, friend troubles, parent troubles, alien troubles and so on. But the most problem they are handling every day - to keep their secret from the world outside... FBI must not know their secret. Neither must their adopted parents. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Behr and Appleby and Fehr and Delfino was just great. The chemistry between Colin Hanks and Heigl was also good, but they were not such in love as Max/Liz and Michael/Maria were, and anyway Colin Hanks dropped off this TV show after his character Alex Whitman's death in the 2nd season.<br/><br/>It is unusual for such a TV show to have great actors, but this have.<br/><br/>First watching this TV show when I was 14-turning-to-be-15, I am happy I didn't check out this when I was ten. If I did, it had been difficult to relate to the characters and the story, alien part aside.<br/><br/>In fact, I am absolutely sure this can be enjoyed of people of all ages, as it is kinda of a teen story with \"moralic aspects\", which turns to label this TV show not only as a \"sci fi romantic teen drama\" but also a \"family TV show\".", "rating": 10, "helpful": "17 out of 27 found this helpful.", "date": "25 May 2005"}, {"title": " My teenhood favorite", "content": "O what i wouldnt give for a chance to be Liz in this situation?

When he did this he risked the exposure of himself, his sister Isabel, and their friend Michael. But that was just the beginning. Since then, fans haven't looked at the sky the same again. Me included. The show really makes you wonder about how destiny really works. Can you really never escape from it? or Can you create your own?? I guess that's just one of the drawbacks of being Alien Royalty. I say--Be Rebellious..Create your own Destiny. Which is eventually what the \"Pod Squad\" does. In the final episode, \"Graduation\" they leave the Roswell life behind to do some good in the world. The final scene of the episode brought thousands of Roswellians to tears as the \"Dreamers\" Max and Liz came running out of the church. (Max's purposal was just one of the greatest scenes in television history...or at least that's my opinion!) Married at last. By then, I was cheering. This show was nothing less than perfect. It has an extremely large cult following, and not just of teenagers--which is what most believe. My parents watch and love this show. I find this show completely addicting. I watch it now...a lot.

A masterful switch to UPN Roswell has come a long way from it's first season young sophomoric romance.  The characters have become webbed within the lore of Roswell and the 1947 crash. Season one showed a lighthearted romance between not one but three different couples.  Our focus wasn't stirred from the stars of the show though.  Liz Parker played by Shiri Appleby and Max Evans played by Jason Behr brought to light a love labor lost romance.  We sat intrigued and amazed as these two fell madly in love on the screen.  Maria Deluca played by Majandra Delphino and Alex Whitman played by Colin Hanks were well cast as the comedic keys for this Teen Sci-fi drama.  A well-supported cast Isabel Evens played by Katherine Hiegl and Michael Geurin played by Brendan Fehr the other two aliens in the mix.  The first season had me at the edge of my seat and squirming with hilarious one liners and brilliant love scenes.<br/><br/>Shiri Appleby and Jason Behr sizzle on the screen no matter their characters' woes.  Season two opened hard into the Sci-fi aspect with a new main character Tess played by Emilie DeRavin.  A spice thrown into the cake Tess's character was one you loved to hate.  She was a test to Max and Liz's relationship.  With Destiny at hand we were dealt numerous confusing plot devices.  The story of these alien teenagers become more complicated by the episode.  Also a shift in female leads occurred in the second season. Isabel Evens was thrust in front to maybe lure and broaden the male audience.  With this in place the main couple Liz and Max were thrown into angst as Tess moved in slowly but surely.  By the end of Season two post Hybrid Chronicles we saw a flicker in the Roswell Staff writing.  Cry Your Name exemplified a brilliant performance by the entire cast and set forth the end of one of the most underused member Colin Hanks.  Soon Emilie DeRavin's character Tess was also sent aside but not without more obstacles for Liz and Max.<br/><br/>It seems to be a re-occurring theme for Liz and Max the show's star-crossed lovers to be kept apart.  The characters are changing some for the better and some for the worst.  Yet I still sit spellbound for every episode that Jason Katims and Co can give me.  The writing though sometimes rebutted by its Internet audience as inane can have you slapping your head in disbelief. Roswell as a whole has the opportunity to wipe out the world with Roswellian fever.  If only the writers would get it right.  This show is amazing yet it once was out of this world.

The magic of Roswell lay in the three aliens (Max, Michael and Isabel) and the fact that they knew nothing about where they came from or why they were on Earth. All Max Evans knew was that for some reason, he was in love with Liz Parker. They were faced with trouble from the government, who wanted to study them, and strangers who claimed to be related to them, but they were never sure who they could trust except each other. Even after Genie Francis appeared in holo-mom form with a ridiculous tale of inter-galactic royalty and war, the show could have been saved - that hologram should have been revealed as a tactic by the mindwarping Tess, but the aliens made the mistake of not doubting it for a second.

I would put Roswell with The OC and Riverdale (so far) up to the/my top 3 shows of all times, and this is why: yes, it is a Teenie drama, yes, it was cheesy sometimes, but it was about storytelling. This was what made Hollywood great, its focus was on the story and on the chracters it was trying to portray, and it did this extremely well. The show was fun, thrilling, and a bit of romance (well, a lot, but this was not the most important thing for me), a bit of a message (of tolerance and not judging outsiders) - but on a normal, natural level, as it should be. I loved it when I was young and I enjoy watching it now that I am old(er), but hearing that a remake will be done rather gives me the creeps. And reading the plans confirms that unwell feeling. Like with pretty much every other show nowadays (the aforementioned Riverdale being an amazing, positive exception so far), this remake can only be unsufferable since it will probably not be about storytelling anymore, like every other show nowadays it seems to be intended to create a vehicle for political propaganda or to be frank: to spread hate. And seeing how actors/actresses are being cast for/horseshoed into characters today just for political reasons, like it happened with the remake of Charmed: first they cast an Afro-American, then they cast a Latin American - I am not saying that casting other ethnicities is bad, but it should happen naturally, because it fits the characters, without calculation, color-blind, not affirmative racist - and if you need a villain, he gets a German (sounding) name, this is Hollywood's recipe for anything at the moment. Cast by color of skin and bring in Nazis -if it fits or not. So if there is a remake of Roswell done (esp. when mixing it with the topic of illegal immigrants), it will be very different from the story, characters, spirit of the original and you can brace yourself for Nazi Aliens for sure, I mean after Nazi zombies, Nazi Vampires, Nazi everything, it makes as much sense as all the other Nazi BS - this is what is left of Hollywood, a shame.

The entire show is faithful to the Bourne series not only story, cinematography, style, and feel but also in its multiple global locations. It's sort of an origin story for the indoctrination program that created Jason Bourne and the operatives like him. The fight scenes are high quality and Bourne-worthy and I have no doubt the actors trained very hard to pull these off. Kudos to the fight choreographer as well. I'm a big Bourne fan-I read the books in the 1980's and have owned and watched the movies multiple times and still think they are among the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I am enjoying this show more than The Bourne Legacy movie. Those who complain the story is confusing are likely not paying attention while watching or are so used to watching shows/movies where every detail is spelled out to the viewer. (See this guy with the black leather jacket, the nasty scar on his face, the milky dead eye, and the cat on his lap, well he's the bad guy). This is a somewhat layered espionage storyline that switches between present-day and 1973. The premise is that in 1973, the Treadstone project started creating sleeper agents cleverly named cicadas (insects that lay dormant for 17 years before returning in droves). Some unknown person is waking up these cicada operatives (who don't even know they are badasses) and sending them on missions to kill people with the ultimate goal of selling a decommissioned and unaccounted Cold War Russian nuclear missile to the North Koreans. Through period flashbacks, we get to see the Russians re-program captured CIA officers, completely wiping their memories and allegiance to the USA and turning them into badasses. Clearly, something goes wrong with one such operative who is on a quest to figure out who he is/was, what happened to him, what he's done, and who he needs to blame and seek vengeance on. In typical Bourne style, there is intrigue which forces you to pay attention, make connections, and wait for reveals. I know some people like to veg in front of the idiot box and not think, but not being spoon-fed a simplistic story is part of the enjoyment of this genre for me. Imagine that, TV you actually need to think about! The movies were also like this, but I suppose for some a chapter title that says \"Budapest 1973\" is not a big enough clue to let them know that what follows is a flashback to the early days of the Treadstone-type project. And if they can't decipher an on screen title written in plain English, perhaps it's too much to expect that the distinctive clothing, music, characters, names, and storyline would be clues they could pick up on to let them know they are watching a different subplot. Perhaps these viewer should stick to the Real Housewives. I would recommend they read a book to learn how to follow multiple subplots, but then again, the subtitles of my the Korean and Russian characters in this show are probably too much reading already. The reviewers who really confound me are the ones who claim to be confused by 'look alike' actors. The main storylines involve a North Korean woman, a black woman with a British accent, and a bearded American man of middle age. The only characters who are even the same race and age are two white males in their late 20's, but these characters are separated by 46 years and completely different sets, costumes, and storylines. One is a recently woken sleeper agent married to a brunette American and the other is a single man undergoing brainwashing by a Russian redhead. Aside from everyone and everything around these two characters being different, one looks like a male model and the other looks like Kevin Dillon. Anyone who can't tell these characters apart should be screened for face-blindness. This is a good show for any Bourne fan with at least half a brain.

I also liked the idea behind the storyline.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the original storyline was washed away by adding more and more esoteric and religious nonsense in S3 and S4 , which amounted in the praise of a new Jesus (Jordan Collier) with a cult like movement willing to sacrifice half of the population of the earth because of some book and visions, a way that was hardly questioned in the end (altough it ends on a cliffhanger),and was indeed portrayed as good.<br/><br/>The whole mess started out when they added that rival group from the future trying to sabotage the 4400 with grown up Isabelle, instead of focusing on what really happens in the future (which was never made clear) and how the 4400 should prevent it, I mean set some milestones! By that time unfortunately a lot of plot holes started to emerge too, for example abducting Maia again and sending her further back into the past, or Tom committing \"suicide\" and being send back, Elena being abducted and send back further in the past too. I mean if it's just that easy to send everybody around in time and bring someone back from the dead into another dimension, what's the point of the 4400 anyway? Then everything goes, why not sending someone back to the ancient Romans and change course there, and if you don't succeed try again in the middle ages. ^^ They really should have focused more on the upcoming catastrophe in the future, on how and when it's going to start, how to prevent it.<br/><br/>Another frustrating factor were the relationships of Tom and Diana in S3 and 4. I mean I appreciate the fact that they for one time didn't do the obvious and brought Diana and Tom together, but their relationships seemed random and meaningless to the storyline, even Tom and Elana, but especially Diana and Marco/ Ben.<br/><br/>But the most upsetting part was the \"let's bring god to earth\" and \"the solution for paradise is everybody on promicin\" storyline. I guess looking back 2004-2007 was a time were evangelicals were on the rise in America and maybe that storyline reflects that a little bit, but it was unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>The idea behind this whole storyline alone contradicts everything we learned throughout the first 2 seasons, and that is that people with abilities are not automatically better human beings than people without. Just like the regulars some of them used their powers for good, some of the for their own sake or fraud, and some of them to hurt and kill people. I mean even the abilities itself were not in every case designed to do good, some of them were (like healing), others just caused destruction, chaos or violence.<br/><br/>That all was negated in S4 and especially in the finale, just do what some vision/ ability and an old book tells you (dumbest character of the series: Kyle) and give everybody an ability or let them die, because then you'll get heaven on earth, sure, no one out of billions of people will ever use an ability to kill somebody anymore, hallelujah, we are all reborn *facepalm*.<br/><br/>When you start skipping some scenes while watching to get to the end you know something has been lost in S3 and S4, and that's what happened when I watched.

The other is a CDC investigator (I gather that being abducted by aliens is also considered some sort of disease).

After a very solid, yet writers strike shortened first season, The 4400 looked like it was going to be Heroes meets the X-Files, easily the next big thing in science fiction television. If that wasn't enough to interest fans, the show also had a head start, as its creators weren't newcomers. The 4400 was the brainchild of Rene Echevarria (Star Trek: The Next Generation) and Scott Peters (V, The Outer Limits). The show looked like a can't miss, then came Season 2...<br/><br/>Seattle Washington, 2004 - It's a seemingly normal night, when a space satellite picks up something unusual. Government agencies are in a panic, as this weird object descends over a mountain lake and emits a bright white light before vanishing. Once it's gone, 4400 people stand on the banks of the lake, 4400, who as it would turn out, have at one time or another been missing since as far back at the 1940s and as recently as six months ago. There's a big to do about what to do with these people, but they are soon released and a new agency is tasked with tracking and monitoring them. A seemingly easy job, until it's discovered that many of them have developed super human abilities.<br/><br/>The premise of the show is fantastic, on top of that it was created by one of the guys who is behind Star Trek: The Next Generation, basically a God in my eyes, and if that weren't enough it features Joel Gretsch, who is one of the most believable, realistic actors to ever play a federal agent in the history of television. This show had everything going for it, even the ratings were good, so why did they have to go and change things so much! Despite good ratings and reviews, people thought the show was too much like the X-files, so they turned the 4400 into this kind of religious cult. Instead of being a mostly episonic show with underling story lines, the show went continuous, spending all of it's time following just a handful of characters. The line between good and bad, blurred, and most times you really couldn't follow who was doing what for whom and why anyone was doing what they were doing. After the first season, there were a couple of good episodes here and there but by season 3, the whole thing had just completely fallen apart.<br/><br/>I readily admit that I watch far more television than most people and far more than television than any normal person should, so trust me when I tell you, that in all my years of doing this, I have never seen a show go so quickly from as good as the 4400 was, to as bad as it became. It defied all logic, honestly did the actors and network involved in producing the shows not realize that after a while the whole thing just didn't make any sense anymore? The bottom line is that the 4400 should have been the next Heroes, X-Files, Lost, Fringe, what have you. It should have been that next big sci-fi show, that had everyone talking.

Yes, there were occasional great episodes, such as the season two finale(which shall remain nameless in this review, to avoid spoilers), and even the rare extraordinary one, such as Life Interrupted. Yes, some of the show was fantastic. Some of the writing was intelligent, realistic. Several points made, themes explored, were very interesting. There was genuinely good and worthwhile science fiction found here. How often do you find that on television? Among the action and the special effects there were parts that were truly impressive. The drama wasn't without accomplished moments. No, this show wasn't all bad. But all the wasted potential is just difficult to overlook. The problem is, the very concept is flawed... it's partially overreaching(twelve episodes per season), and it's also just not limited enough. The obvious gaping plot hole, the logic problem, was never addressed(I cannot reveal what it is here, because it would be a spoiler)... in fact, the show always seemed unwilling to limit itself, for purposes of concise story-telling(and never run out of material... and for an inestimable amount of such, not to mention only having 42 episodes in total, for four seasons, they had far too many episodes that... just weren't all that good). Said storytelling did have something to offer, but not very much. There were too many things that they seemed to never really explain. Plots and ideas were introduced, seldom developed enough, and they either were not concluded, or it was done in an abrupt and unsatisfactory manner. Characters were presented, explored(if even that), and dismissed(another error in that department is arguably taking the Mulder &amp; Scully approach). Acting was hit-and-miss. The symbolism was blatant, sometimes even insulting. It always seemed like it was going somewhere, bigger, smarter, better, and it just never got there.

The Clich\u00e9-ridden dialog ranges from \"I'm worried about you Tom\" and \"Is it supposed to be that bright?\" The latter referring to a fastly closing comet as if the character already saw the episodes of this series and suspected it may not be a comet at all but rather an extra-terrestrial 'Ball of Light' made by a wannabe CGI-expert who normally does the catering.<br/><br/>The Intergalactic marble is counter-measured with ballistic CGI missiles.

One of them is a woman who's been gone for 10 years and thinks it would be a good idea to visit her daughter and husband after so long. When she gets to the house where her husband and daughter live, the screenwriters truly run out of inspiration and quickly down a six-pack of tequila flavored beer.

When the main \"investigator's\" nephew starts to show amazing powers, and eventually becomes the head of the 4400's secretive organization, the governmental agency doesn't balk at one of the most absurd conflicts of interest, which in the real world, would obviously negate his future involvement.

(Nor, in future episodes, when the investigators and government need to know things, like the location or targets of 4400 terrorist, do they employ let alone discuss the use of the child to help them know terrorist targets) Things get even more bizarre when Joel Gretsch's character marries a 4400. Again, no conflict of interest there.

This show started off with some mystery and great potential, now, it has devolved into a bad soap opera, rife with convoluted relationships, in a poor attempt to include issues which were much better covered in Alien Nation, or X-Men, the natural instinct of people to fear the unknown or those who are different.

But here, I said: STOP! and asked me two questions: 1) How the hell would anyone think of such an idea, considering the fact that our world is far, very far from being perfect two thousand years after a Messiah whose name I do not need to mention preached his gospel. 2) Why should humans have to take a shot, as if it were some kind of miraculous cure, to be better, instead of changing their MINDS? Then, those who are familiar with the series should also bear in mind that, although the series ended with a cliffhanger, this one was very badly done, ridiculously showing images of people performing so-called 'miracles' and that stupid thing of Seattle being renamed 'Promise City', and completely evading one fact clearly emerging from that pile of garbage: even if at the end of the series, they found a way to make a test to determine who could or could not take promicine without danger,the fact remains that this 'new world' would be divided between two classes of people: those with abilities and those without, in short, practically two species of humans. Our world is divided enough with one human species and definitely doesn't need one further division: I cannot help but thinking that this crap of a TV series is finally somewhere extremely right-wing, or even racist/fascist in its conclusion.

I realize that isn't edgy enough or dangerous enough for some people, but when you get tired of watching bloodshed and meaningless violence, you will appreciate this show. The stories are well-written, and generally well-paced. They take you all over, in the sense that they solve mysteries and reunite people and discover secrets and do not follow a \"murder of the week\" sort of formula. <br/><br/>The main themes of the episodes are love, friendship, respect. One reviewer referred to this show as \"housewifey\", which is insanely patronizing, but what he probably meant is that it doesn't have any bimbos jiggling their naked boobs for the camera and isn't bloodthirsty enough for his \"masculine\" taste. And it's not, so if you must exist on a strict diet of sex and violence, skip this show.<br/><br/>The main characters are more nerdy than they are glamorous, but since when is the entire world made up of models? They rely on their brains, decency, teamwork, and perseverance to get the job done. We haven't seen characters like Rita and Norman in any show that I know of (Rita has her Sheldon Cooper moments but she is a much nicer person). I find the inevitable falling in love of Oliver and Shane to be predictable, but that's OK too; watching their story unfold is very enjoyable. <br/><br/>The acting is good. I enjoy the work of actors who can get across an emotion or idea with only a facial expression.<br/><br/>There isn't much laugh-out-loud comedy on the show. It is certainly charming and will make you smile rather than laugh. Occasionally I have small criticisms of how specific matters are done in the show. For example, I thought that when Oliver and Shane were locked in the bank vault with the young banker, it was a bit of a cop-out to have the young man take a nap to make room for the private letter-reading between Oliver and Shane.

We have too many let's race shows, talent shows and way too many cop shows that show the seedy side of life.

Most women, especially virgins or Christian women, are not drawn to or entertained by sex, pornography or films where women are degraded worse than animals (unless they are lesbians, of course) as is the case with Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>The user finishes the stereotypical complaint by complaining of the \"4/4\" male/female romances in the show.

No. Not at all. And because these elements of the human condition are included, is humor, laughter, and joy excluded? Of course not.

In this case, a magical woman complicates the life of a mortal man, even as she tries to help him through his problems.<br/><br/>But let's stay on topic. NASA Astronaut Captain Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman), on a space mission, went up, but something went wrong and they had to bring him down. His capsule came to earth on a tiny desert island where he discovers a bottle; he opens it and in a puff of smoke a genie (Barbara Eden) appears.

Eventually, that engagement got broken off, leaving Tony free to play the field, and Jeannie to get angry about his other women. And the two buddies get promotions from Captains to Majors.<br/><br/>Lots more complications, like Jeannie's Sister, an evil, raven haired twin who was out to enslave Nelson for her boy toy, The Blue Djinn turns up (played by Eden's husband at the time, Michael Ansara), who first put Jeannie into the bottle, and even her dog Djinn Djinn (didn't the writers know any other Arabic words?) who had a pension for disappearing and then tearing any uniform he saw to shreds... not a good thing on an Air Force Base! <br/><br/>The charm of the show was in Hagman's incredible ability to go from deadpan to fully reactionary on a dime (something he was required to do in nearly every episode), and Eden's brilliance at playing the petulant brat still learning about the 20th Century World, and with whom no one could be angry for very long. Daily was a great foil for both of them, (though I never understood why his uniform was GREEN) and of course, there was Dr. Bellows (the incomparable Hayden Roarke), intrepid base psychiatrist, who always knew something funny was going on, but could never quite prove it to anyone. Certainly part of the show's success was in his slow burns after whatever he was going to prove to whichever General was in command didn't pan out! <br/><br/>Though one has to wonder how they managed to do a contemporary mid 1960s program on and around a Military installation without so much as a passing reference to Vietnam!

Bewitched was created after the success of the movie \"Bell, Book, and Candle\" (staring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak). In the early sixties, the women's movement was strong and changed the shape of society. June Cleaver (Leave it to Beaver) cleaning the house in \"pearls and high heels\" was to be challenged. Bewitched offered a love story between a husband and wife, where the wife had real power (in this case Samantha's magic). This presented a new tension to what viewers were used to (although it always ended with a love note). With Jeannie, we have a great deal of sexual tension created! What man would not wish for a beautiful magical servant, albeit deviant at times. Kinda sexy in the sixties when sexual openness was being discussed for the first time (although not directly in the media).

The closest parallel would be Samantha's mother, Endora, in \"Bewitched\". Barbara Eden was perfect for the role and the other lead players in the form of Larry Hagman (who later went on to achieve superstar status as evil J R in \"Dallas\"), Bill Daily and Hayden Rorke played their roles to perfection.<br/><br/>Like most series that are spontaneous, the cast members got along very well on and off screen, as verified by their comments in a filmed reunion interview found on the recently released DVD set.<br/><br/>In IDOJ, the sizzle comes from the developing romantic relationship between an unmarried, eligible bachelor played by Hagman and a beautiful, tempestuous lady; whereas in its witchcraft themed rival show, the romance between the lead characters was already established in a marriage and the setting was more domesticated.

The show was created and produced by Sidney Sheldon,whom after the show went off the air became one of the most influential writers of the latter century. And this was produced under the powers that be through Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures Television(the same company that was responsible for \"Bewitched\",\"The Flying Nun\",and \"The Monkees\"). The show gobbled up its competition for much of its run,and when it went off the air,it left with just a whisper. The show bordered on farce most of the time,with Barbara Eden not only played Jeannie,but Jeannie's evil twin sister and Jeannie's mother.

Whatever the case may be, I'm GLAD \"Jeannie\" was left on. I \"lazily\" began watching it and gradually began liking it quite a bit.<br/><br/>Basically, \"Jeannie\" is a genie who ended up in the custody of NASA astronaut Tony Nelson. As some TV Land commercial points out, most men with a genie would wish for greedy things like riches and ...probably more than that, but Tony mostly just seems to like Jeannie for her companionship. Jeannie and Tony do have a nice friendship (they eventually get married), but it isn't always an easy one. Jeannie gets Tony in trouble a lot, whether he's with friends, other girls, or even at NASA--particularly, in fact, at NASA, where suspicious psychiatrist Dr. Alfred Bellows always seems to be a witness of Tony and Jeannie's strange antics, though nobody ever believes him when he tries to report what he sees.<br/><br/>Some of Jeannie's tricks make the show silly, dull, or just plain boring. I don't, for example, care for when Jeannie blinks (that is how she gets things done, by folding her arms and blinking) Tony back in time, to Persia (where Jeannie is \"from,\" although she's about as non-Arabic looking as it gets) into some silly situation like making Tony wear no pants or something. Jeannie also has things like a \"jealous streak\" that make her occasionally downright unlikable. She \"blinked\" Tony into a jail cell once, keeping him from seeing an old friend, and once wanted to KILL some foreign princess. <br/><br/>\nHowever, \"Jeannie\" lasted for five years, so not ALL of the episodes involved the above-mentioned situations. Many are downright amusing, particularly episodes involving Dr. and Mrs. Bellows, the uptight NASA psychiatrist and his nosy wife who tend to be the only witnesses of Jeannie's tricks. Bill Daily, as Tony's best friend, fellow NASA astronaut and resident womanizer Roger Healy, is also amusing, and I actually prefer him in \"Jeannie,\" to \"The Bob Newhart Show.\" As \"Jeannie\" and \"Tony\" Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman are also extremely good--both together (I hate it when actors playing TV couples have no chemistry)and in individual scenes. \"Jeannie\" may be unlikable when she is acting jealous, but the rest of the time she's bubbly and clueless and has a sort of charm (which is why I don't like when she acts jealous). Scenes where Jeannie ends up doing conventional things like going to the market, buying a dress, or going to the beauty parlor, are some of the more amusing. <br/><br/>As for Larry Hagman, well, I didn't grow up in the 1960's, but if I had, he sort of seems like an actor whose career I would have followed with some interest, even though I'm not sure if I've seen him in anything else. As Tony, Hagman is put into numerous silly and embarrassing situations (I've read about actors complaining about the scripts, which is something I occasionally dislike hearing. I would say Hagman had good cause to do so) from having about every costume imaginable \"blinked\" onto him, to running around screaming (and cursing? It sure sounds like it) after being \"blinked\" mouse-high (I personally didn't care for this episode, but I was watching it as somebody was painting the front door and I kept hearing them snickering), and numerous other slap-stick situations that vary in levels of amusement. At first glance, especially in his astronaut's uniform, Hagman SEEMS like an actor who...couldn't pull that off, but he does, and is able to maintain Tony Nelson's super-serious demeanor with it. It is a nice achievement, but sometimes as I watch, I think silly things to myself like \"poor Larry Hagman.\" Tony's still fun to watch, and I especially like his interactions with Dr. Bellows and with Jeannie, as the two, as I have mentioned have wonderful chemistry together. I can very much imagine people speculating as to whether or not they were an \"item\" in real life, due to how convincing they are.<br/><br/>I think it's the high quality of acting that really makes this show \"work\" for me.

The fact is that the show was extremely funny and still is. The main reason for the success was the two leads in Eden and Hagman. Both were fine comic actors. Hagman's ability to employ slapstick humor made him funny. Barbara Eden was just as talented: her genius is exemplified when she plays her sister. You can barely tell it's the same person.

'I Dream of Jeannie' is one such show, has much enjoyment still and perhaps deserves more credit.<br/><br/>'I Dream of Jeannie', with the unique (then and even now) concept of the pairing of a genie and an astronaut, is a dream to watch when at its best and is still watchable when it isn't quite. Like 'Bewitched', a show that is often compared with 'I Dream of Jeannie' (put them about equal myself), the early seasons fare better than the later ones, where the stories do start to lack freshness and the sexual tension is stronger in the earlier seasons.<br/><br/>Also, 'I Dream of Jeannie' can have some sloppy continuity errors and can fall into silliness, like going back in time in Persia.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'I Dream of Jeannie' is particularly noteworthy for the very likable and memorable assortment of characters, the regulars are not easy to forget and the supporting/secondary cast are really good fun, and a great cast.<br/><br/>Barbara Eden is beautiful, charming and sensual, you would be hard pressed to find genies portrayed in this way. Larry Hagman's mannerisms are a true joy and Hagman has wonderful comic timing and endearment that is deserving of more credit. His chemistry with Eden is one of a kind, one of television's finest ever chemistries and a huge part of the show's appeal.<br/><br/>There has probably never been a funnier doctor in television than the hilariously prissy one portrayed by Hayden Rorke.

For the 60s, the show does still look pretty good. Like with 'Bewitched', the effects are not always special (particularly early on) and there could have been more of them but most of the time they are hardly slapdash and have real charm. The bottle is famous for good reason.<br/><br/>Music is dynamic and groovy, with all the theme music tunes being noteworthy. The animated opening sequence is both beautiful and lively and is utilised cleverly. The expository narration of the first few episodes, up to episode 8, delivered by Paul Frees was not used as much and not as striking as the animated sequence, but nonetheless was interesting and made its mark.<br/><br/>Writing is funny, snappy, charming and thoughtful, while the stories have magic, sexual tension, charm and immense likability on the most part, though the earlier seasons have more freshness.<br/><br/>Overall, a dream to watch. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "rating": 8, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "19 September 2017"}, {"title": " Loved this show...", "content": "...mainly for Barbara Eden.

But we love him too much and are pulling for him too much to ever call him a loser. He never has any money. He lives in a dilapidated trailer on the beach. He's not married. He was in prison, though he didn't commit the crime and was pardoned. Helluva way to treat one of our ex-servicemen (Korea).

Just call &amp; leave the message, Jim will get back with you.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "14 January 2007"}, {"title": " Perfect Series Television", "content": "I'm of the opinion that The Rockford Files did nothing less than save James Garner's career. I yield to no one in my admiration for this man as an actor. I read somewhere that it was said of him he makes every thing he's in just a little bit better by being there.<br/><br/>But it was clear that his movie career at the time he was offered The Rockford Files was waning, he was not getting the good parts he once had on the big screen. What to do, but go back to television where Maverick had made him a big star.<br/><br/>Though Garner's character and personality were certainly an integral part of the show, what I think set The Rockford Files apart was the terrific writing of each and every episode and the creation of some indelible characters. The best of course was Stuart Margolin as Angel Martin who was con man. Margolin did four or five episodes a year with The Rockford Files and he pulled Garner into one of his crazy schemes in every episode and Garner had to be resourceful to get them out.<br/><br/>Garner was an ex-convict who apparently took a fall for some other people. His prison experience certainly toughened him and he went into the private detective business when paroled.<br/><br/>Naturally the LAPD as do other police agencies don't like private eyes as a general rule and ex-con PIs really gets their collective backs up. Jim Rockford had a running battle with Lieutenant Chapman played beautifully by James Luisi who was never convinced Garner was on the up and up. Rockford had a good friend in Joe Santos as Sergeant later Lieutenant Dennis Becker who ran interference for him.<br/><br/>He also had the support of his dad, Noah Beery, Jr. who was a retired truck driver and who occasionally got roped into some of Garner's cases as well. And he had a pretty lady lawyer Gretchen Corbett and with his relations with the cops, Garner had to have her on speed dial.<br/><br/>Gretchen Corbett got a great career role in Beth Davenport. I'm not sure why she's not mentioned more as a feminist icon, a successful female professional if there ever was one on television.<br/><br/>And other semi-recurring characters were folks like Isaac Hayes as Gandolf Finch another prison buddy, a man of few words and a demeanor that made Mr. T look like a friendly tour guide. Tom Selleck was here also as another private eye, Lance White, who kept getting credit for some of the grunt work Garner put in. This part led him to his own television series Magnum which in fact was patterned a lot on The Rockford Files. The show was rich with characters.<br/><br/>The Rockford Files to me is perfect series television, entertaining without condescension to the lowest common denominator. After physical problems forced the cancellation, James Garner came back in the nineties to do several Rockford television films. They were good, but face it Garner was getting old and tending to the gut a bit more.<br/><br/>With his recent stroke and the fact he's now 80 years old, I don't think another Rockford Files is in the cards. I wish it weren't so", "rating": 10, "helpful": "8 out of 10 found this helpful.", "date": "12 July 2008"}, {"title": " The Best of the 1970s Detective Shows", "content": "American television audiences were very undemanding in the 1970s, so we ended up with innumerable average-to-bad detective shows. All of these were pretty much variations on the same whodunit theme, but networks tried (generally unsuccessfully) to liven things up by giving their characters \"unique\" personal qualities. Thus, we were barraged with endless variations on the \"unique detective\": a fat, grumpy detective (Cannon), a wise old detective (Barnaby Jones), a blind detective (Longstreet), an ethnic, bald detective who liked candy (Kojak), a mumbling, slouching detective in an old overcoat (Columbo), a blue-collar detective with a cute pet bird (Baretta), a WASP-ish detective (Mannix), husband-and-wife detectives (McMillan and Wife), a young guy-old guy detective team (The Streets of San Francisco, Switch), a flashy Las Vegas detective (Vega$), a cowboy detective in New York (McCloud), a buddy detective team with a fast red car (Starsky and Hutch), and so on.<br/><br/>Most of these series were mediocre to poor as entertainment, primarily because they were so ridiculously unrealistic. \"Starsky and Hutch\" and \"Baretta\" were probably the worst, which means they were REALLY bad. One series was unpretentious and had an established star, however. Of course, I'm talking about James Garner in \"The Rockford Files\", which ran from 1974 to 1980. Garner's tremendous easygoing appeal carried the show without gimmickry, and the scripts were generally excellent. Sure, there were car chases and fights, but \"The Rockford Files\" was easy to take, and was without the contrived ridiculousness of the others. Noah Beery, Jr., an established character actor in his own right, contributed to the show's charm.<br/><br/>I miss \"The Rockford Files\" quite a bit. The show didn't take itself too seriously and James Garner was fun to watch. You can keep all the other detective shows of the 1970s, but let me have this one and its memories.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "6 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "24 April 2008"}, {"title": " Among the best the '70s had to offer", "content": "\"Rockford\" showed up on the small screen nearly 35 years ago. That's a long time, and the world has changed a lot since then. This makes it even more satisfying to see how well the show has held up over the years. While the cars, hairstyles, and clothing are noticeably dated, the endearing characters, intelligent writing, and clever story lines aren't.<br/><br/>Jim Rockford is an atypical TV hero, especially for the 1970s. He is often cranky and impatient, and he usually wants nothing to do with a case unless it's going to put his usual $200/day plus expenses in his pocket. However, after being talked into reluctant participation into many of his capers, Rockford displays an unusual sense of morality. Once he finds someone getting the short end of the stick, he can't turn his back on them until he puts things right -- even at his own life's peril.<br/><br/>The supporting cast really makes this show. All have a complex, sometimes unexplained relationship with Rockford that is often unconventional. Angel Martin is an extremely shady ex-con who constantly lies to Rockford and gets him into trouble, yet the viewer comes to eventually understand their strange friendship, as Jim begrudgingly takes the good with the bad. Beth Davenport's relationship with Rockford is never clarified. It's implied they had or have some sort of romantic involvement, but the relationship seems open, and at times, just a friendship. However, the viewer gets the sense that the two care about one another very much, and the strong, educated Ms. Davenport is a refreshing departure from damsel-in-distress characters of the time. Sgt. Dennis Becker is Jim's friend, but he isn't shy to share his suspicions that Rockford is often using him for information and police protection, nor is he reluctant to complain that Jim's ever-presence is preventing his advancement within the LAPD. Even Rockford's own father has an unconventional relationship with him, as Jim refers to him as \"Rocky\" and treats him as more of a best friend than a father. Rocky is more trusting and happy-go-lucky than his cranky, cynical son, but the two of them have an excellent chemistry that is even touching at times. It helped that Noah Beery and James Garner had a physical resemblance, as well.<br/><br/>The show had a few mainstays that were present in nearly every episode. It always had its share of humor, though often subtle. There were always a few exciting car chase scenes, however improbable that they could take place on L.A. streets without ever running into traffic. Someone always seemed to find a way to break into Rockford's trailer and either tear the place up, attack him, or both. Apparently he never learned his lesson about investing in some better locks. Regardless of these patterns, however, the show remained fresh and interesting throughout its entire run, especially with the creative writers they were fortunate enough to employ.<br/><br/>The Rockford Files was one of the most expensive shows to produce at the time, given its extensive use of on-location shooting throughout Los Angeles and its surrounding cities. While I'm sure this made things tougher on the staff, it especially enhances the show now, as one now has an excellent look at 1970s Los Angeles. It's especially invigorating for me to see this, as memories of my childhood there come rushing back with every scene change.<br/><br/>I did not start watching this series until 2007.

After a myriad of repeats of everything from \"Teen Mom\" to \"Jersey Shore,\" it's nice to see a decent teen comedy show on the air once again.<br/><br/>I really mean it when I say that \"Awkward.\" is a decent show. No, correction: it's an above average show that manages to actually be very funny, in addition to being very raunchy. Think about MTV's other semi-good teen comedy series, \"The Hard Times of RJ Berger.\" Like \"Hard Times,\" \"Awkward.\" has been easily influenced by the recent wave of popular teen comedies at the movies, most notably 2010's \"Easy A\" (this show's premise borrows a central plot element from that film).<br/><br/>\"Awkward.\" is also heavily influenced by the films of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), that Brat Pack filmmaker behind such classics as \"Sixteen Candles\" (1984), \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) (my personal favorite), and \"Pretty in Pink\" (1986). Using those movies as an influence for its plot basis, \"Awkward.\" tells the story of Jenna Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), a virtual 15-year-old nobody at a posh Southern California high school. She narrates the show through her online blog postings.<br/><br/>It's clearly established early on that Jenna is in fact, quite wise beyond her years, so obviously that has got to make her a target from the more popular students. Rickards is able to give her character a sense of humanity and vulnerability, and Social \"Awkward\"-ness, that makes her seem like a real person and not a Molly Ringwald stereotype (a moment extremely late in the third episode really makes this clear). In fact, Rickards's Jenna Hamilton and Ringwald's bright-and-beautiful-but-socially-rejected John Hughes-era characters - Samantha Baker in \"Sixteen Candles\" and Andie Walsh in \"Pretty in Pink,\" namely - are so close in age (and emotional maturity) that it's entirely possible that Jenna *could* be Ringwald's offspring from those years.<br/><br/>During the summer, Jenna had a brief affair with Matty (Beau Mirchoff), the hottest hunk in school, and said affair ultimately resulted in her losing her virginity. The problem is that Jenna and every other girl in school is lusting after Matty, who does in fact appear to have genuine feelings for Jenna but does not want to take their relationship public, for obvious reasons. As the season begins, the new school year has just started and we're shown Jenna's daily life as a societal outcast at her school, her promiscuous best friend Tamara (Jillian Rose Reed), and her overweight cheer-leading nemesis - and resident mean girl/queen bee - Sadie (Molly Tarlov).<br/><br/>Before you know it, a freak accident one night in her bathroom results in a misconstrued rumor that Jenna had tried to commit suicide, and the rumor mill at her school goes ballistic with the news. A la Emma Stone's social-climbing Olive Pendergast in \"Easy A,\" Jenna is thrust to the top of the high school social ladder - she's the new \"it\" girl that everyone is talking about, for better or for worse - and she also has to deal with the common trials &amp; tribulations of being a socially Awkward teenager on the verge of adulthood.<br/><br/>\"Awkward.\" is a genuinely funny and entertaining show, if you have a thing for teen shows. Sure it rehashes a lot of what we've seen in the past to the point that it's pretty much overkill. And Lord knows we've seen enough teen comedies over the years to know what to expect from shows like this. But where \"Awkward.\" gets points is, I think, is its knowledge of its influences, namely the works of John Hughes. Hughes was known for complex, yet uniquely human portrayals of teenagers in his films and \"Awkward.\" appears to display some of the humanist complexities that Hughes had made his trademark back in the '80s. You can see it with Jenna and how torn she is between Matty and another popular hunk named Jake (Brett Davern).<br/><br/>With this in mind, this series definitely shows promise, promise that I hope is not squandered on stupid sex jokes, humor, and raunchiness - although there is already plenty of that here.<br/><br/>Awkward.<br/><br/>8/10", "rating": 8, "helpful": "79 out of 88 found this helpful.", "date": "7 August 2011"}, {"title": " It's fantastic, very funny and not a fake teenage drama!", "content": "Not the typical, American teenagers lives are perfect show and there's no singing or dancing after every drama.<br/><br/>Awkward shows how life can be brutal for kids in school and there there are a lot of bitches about, everybody can relate to something in there one way or another, but does also address some serious issues like weight and depression.

She was all over the place and changed her mind about loving someone almost daily. A good portion of the series Jenna was twitching her face all the time while thinking her relationship with Matty. In the beginning it had seemed cute but started to annoy a lot when the supposed strong leading female character was insecure as hell. Someone should have counted how many times Jenna &amp; Matty fell of the wagon &amp; back to loving each other throughout the series. It was ridiculous and ruined seasons 3, 4 and 5 completely and even in the end there was not a happy ending. I was left wondering if this character goes through her life questioning everything. Never settling and never actually having a meaningful long relationship. And she was supposed to be the smart one of the group. Maybe the writers tried to create sex and the city for teens. Or maybe Jenna was what writers want to be or are. It definitely wasn't what viewers want to see &amp; what would be smart to write.

It was addicting. I waited rather desperately for the rest of season 3 to premiere, and when it did, I watched the first few episodes, and I got to a point where I just couldn't watch anymore. Reality set in and I really how horrible of a show this ended up being.<br/><br/>The show's plot line, characterization and character development, and everything in between are just awful. Yes, I realize that this is an American teen comedy/drama on MTV of all places, but that isn't an excuse for having just a bad show.<br/><br/>First off, the show is way too unrealistic. TV is supposed to be a place where you can \"escape reality\" and such. Even reality shows aren't one bit realistic. But some shows get to a point where the unrealistically is just untasteful. These characters are supposed to be 15 and eventually 17 or so. All the actors playing them are over 20 and couldn't pass as 15 year olds (with the exception of a couple) even if they tried. MAYBE they could've passed as seniors, but never 15 year olds. <br/><br/>Another part of how unrealistic this show is is just their lives in general. It feels like ALL these characters think about or focus on it relationships and sex. Honestly. What about school? I know that no one goes to watch TV to see a bunch of teenagers worrying about school, but if you're going to have a TV show where a large part of the scenes are set in a school and the characters are high school students, you can't just completely disregard any thoughts about homework or studying or projects or any of that. From experience, homework practically takes over your life in high school. I barely have time to do anything else when I'm done with my homework.<br/><br/>The two main guys are supposed to be on sports teams. As a high school athlete, I can tell you that high school sports are another thing that literally take over your life. By the time I get home from practice, it's almost time for dinner and the rest of my time is spent on homework. On the contrary, Matty and Jake, who are supposed to be the popular \"jocks\", hardly ever mention anything to do with playing sports. This is something I'm probably going to mention again that I see a LOT on Awkward: The inconsistency and inability to follow through with something. Matty and Jack are \"jocks\" that never seem to have any practice or game to go to. Way to follow through.<br/><br/>Second off is characterization/character development. The characterization/character development of Jenna, the main character, is ATROCIOUS. Honestly. She starts off the show as an \"unpopular\" awkward girl who is working as a camp counselor at a summer camp, when suddenly, fellow counselor Matty, the hot, popular guy from her school, gives her ONE look and they go to a closet and he takes her virginity. Suddenly, just a couple episodes later, is popular and has two boys vying for her and her attention. Not to mention that suddenly Jenna is extremely sex driven. What happened to being unpopular? What happened to the old Jenna? Aside from the few (and far between) moments where she has seemingly \"awkward\" moments, the Jenna that used to be unpopular and awkward is gone like she never existed. This is another example of the inconsistency of this show.<br/><br/>I found Jenna to be an extremely unlikeable character. At the very, very beginning, I found her to be somewhat relatable in that she was unpopular and awkward. After the whole Colin drama, I was honestly disgusted with her and thought the show would be much better off if we just got rid of the character, despite the fact that Jenna IS the main character of the show. As the seasons went on, I saw Jenna slowly throwing away any morals that she may have had. By the time Colin rolled around and that whole drama started happening, all the morals were completely gone. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters lacked real character development, consistency in whatever characterization they may have had, and being realistic. I could go on about it for much longer. The show got to a point where it was unenjoyable to watch, so I stopped watching.

It's a subject that has fascinated man from the beginning of time, be it in the tales of the ancient Greek gods and demigods or people's obsession over vampires. Naturally, Hollywood and television have gotten into the act many times over, from 1986's \"Highlander\" to the latest incarnation, ABC's amazing but sadly short lived \"Forever\". It stars Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Henry Morgan, chief medical examiner for the New York City crime lab. Henry is just like you and me; he goes to work, pays his bills, and has a charming attitude about him. Except, he is immortal, born roughly 200 years ago, his immortality seemly beginning with a mortal gunshot wound and being thrown overboard from a slave ship after he tried to intervene in the brutal treatment of a slave. Now every time Henry is killed, he always comes back in water and always naked. The only person who knows about Henry's condition is Abe (Judd Hirsch), Henry's long time friend, business partner, and, despite Abe looking considerably older than Henry, son. Together they run an antique shop, while Henry goes out, solves crime, and picks up clues that no one else seems able to. But this idyllic life comes to a halt when Henry learns that someone else with his ability is in town, someone who, unlike Henry, does not live by the same morals (Burn Gorman in a tour de force performance as Adam, a 2,000 year old immortal). From there on, it's a cat and mouse game between the two while Henry also must solve crimes and maintain relationships with his co-workers at the precinct while also making sure they never learn his secret. A charming, well-written story that had plenty of action, suspense, and a certain magic about it. All the more reason why it should be canceled after one season!<br/><br/>\"Forever\" was a neat, unique broadcast network show in a long line of such shows that was to meet a quick death at the hands of the ratings count. It didn't matter how good Ioan Gruffudd was in the lead, it didn't matter that he how much charm he had or how much he could make you feel for the character, nor did it matter how good everyone else was in the show, such as Alana De La Garza as Det. Jo Martinez, Henry's co-worker and love interest. Nor did it matter how intriguing the story was, or how much more it made you want to know the secret of Henry's and Adam's condition, and whether or not there were more people in the world with such a condition. Nope, none of that mattered, and as a result - no exaggeration - broke my heart. It still pains me to learn that I won't see Ioan Gruffudd as Henry Morgan, an actor who could more than fill the lead shoes of a show, nor would I learn what caused Henry's and Adam's immortality, nor what it meant for the human race. And those last tid bit's may be the hardest part about \"Forever's\" short run. Because you got the feeling from the last moment of the series finale, that the writers and producers had so much more planned for the series and the story, something that will never be realized now. And for that reason, \"Forever\" may be the final straw when it comes to me checking out new shows, especially on broadcast networks. Every new show seems to be the same, and every time something new does come along, it gets canceled. I no longer have the drive I used to when checking out new shows, I haven't checked out any new broadcast shows lately, and to be honest, I really don't know if I ever will. For it's short run, though, if you can bear having your heart broken for the sake of some good story-telling, \"Forever\" is something that should be checked out.

In doing so they have basically populated the series with ONLY women. That's about as unrealistic a characterization of 1920's society that you can imagine. Murdoch does it right - men seem to be in charge but very strong women - wives, girlfriends, reporters, female private detectives, doctors, etc., are very prominent throughout and realistically portray the reality of the times as well as how strong women did, in fact, find ways to assert themselves, employ their talents, etc. Frankie Drake pretends men didn't exist in their little enterprise.

Even then it would be hard to believe that there would be so much arguing, chest thumping, and complete unprofessional behavior amongst the group during missions. That's the problem with this show. They don't seem to have any understanding of the military. They must be completely disregarding their military advisors in the interest of trying to make it more interesting. Instead, it becomes completely unbelievable and insulting to the real military. Those in the military are taught to respect authority. They don't openly and especially disrespectfully question it. You especially wouldn't expect to find it in our elite special forces teams. When given orders, they follow them. The constant questioning of authority in this show makes them look like a bunch of unprofessional he-man SEAL wannabes. Everyone is also always fighting and arguing amongst themselves and with the CIA. There is a constant display of lack of self control. It's so unbelievably unprofessional. <br/><br/>\nAnother thing that occurs in this show, but is also unrealistically prevalent in many other shows is that when a person of superior rank is speaking, someone of lesser rank or position interrupts with some other bit of information. Actors are constantly jumping in with their lines, with no pauses to make the situation believable. An NCO SEAL team member interrupting an officer would be like a worker interrupting the CEO of their large company. It would be rare and considered insubordinate.

It is the last one that bugs me. Military wives generally fall in to two categories very supportive and what we consider a valuable asset and the slag that is creating constant issues and is what we consider a consistent detriment to the org. Those wives don't last long and unfortunately can create a significant problem. <br/><br/>A wife that gives you the whole you are never here thing is in the latter category. Those of us in high op tempo units know we are never around and our families do too but it is simply an on off switch- if she is giving you constant hassle well she is the off switch and a problem and again- they aren't around very much. <br/><br/>Also, while I recognize the team and dets within the SEAL community have a more relaxed discipline than we do they went a bit over board here. Members of a high op tempo org do not sit around constantly questioning and griping or talking about the leadership behind their backs. That is poison and is every bit as dangerous as a 30 caliber round to the brain housing group. It may happen on some smaller level but nothing like it does here. The hippy dude or whatever would be a dangerous person to have on a team. The constant doubting and griping is a major disqualifier. He is a whiner and whiners need not apply that is a lack of discipline. <br/><br/>To be clear I am not saying it is always puppy dogs and puffy clouds but it is never and should never be second guessing and questioning. Instant obedience to orders anything less is dangerous. You may for example say- OK my boss told me to take that objective in a certain way but you may adapt as the situation dictates. You don't not stand around saying hey this is BS man that is a long way to run and I don't think you thought this through and besides they are just humans too.

After watching the pilot episode my only disappointment was that it ended as quickly as it seemed to just begin and I wanted to see more, a lot more! The supporting strong cast includes Kim Coates (best known for his role as Alexander 'Tig' Trager in Sons Of Anarchy), who plays Vito Rizzuto's confidant and mob muscle. The series also stars Paul Sorvino, Enrico Colantoni, Tony Nappo and the new dark horse to the crime genre, Brett Donahue, who plays third generation son/grandson Enrico Jr. Rizzuto.<br/><br/>Some viewers may say that there is one scene in the pilot episode of Bad Blood which takes place in a bar back in 1981 that may remind viewers of the violent animal rage displayed by Joe Pesci in the 1990 film Goodfellas. The scene shows a young Vitto Rizzuto and two of his cronies going back in time to 1981 in the dead of winter when they are asked by the bar owner Big Mike, to repay a favor owed to his father, and when called upon by passage of the secret word \"zoo\" Vitto and his two cronies are to proceed to come out of hiding from behind the door and first rough up then rob the three Bonnano mob bosses that will be in the bar with the bar owner who himself is also a mob boss. I will not go into detail other than to say that this particular nights event will come back to haunt the older Vitto Rizzuto three decades later.<br/><br/>If you are not yet familiar with the Montreal based Rizzuto crime family, this six (6) part TV mini-series will not only enlighten you on some factual events but I trust based on the strong showing of this pilot episode and the all-star cast of veteran mobster actors such as Anthony LaPaglia, Paul Sorvino, Enrico Colantoni, Tony Nappo and Kim Coates, you will also hunger for more episodes as quickly as the last one ends, you will want another episode to begin.<br/><br/>I give Bad Blood a superior Badda-Bing, Badda-Boom, 10 for 10 rating.<br/><br/>November 01st, 2018 Update<br/><br/>As much as I liked all of season 1, season 2 is so much better as Kim Coates who plays druglord Declan Gardiner takes over as the series lead role since Anthony LaPaglia's character mob boss \"Vito Rizzuto\" has bitten the dust. The second season has Declan really taking care of (his) business but he has a few distractions, one of those distractions being his troubled and abandoned nephew Reggie Ross (Ryan McDonald), and another being two ultra hip young immigrants from the old country Italy who have come to do the bidding of their Don father who wants a bigger take of the Canadian drug market. Not if Declan has anythig to say about it though.<br/><br/>Season 2 is fantastic with lots of twists and turns and strategies, and of course a string of deserving murders/executions.

A lot of the acting comes off as theatrical vs authentic. Certainly there are violent scenes but they don't really resonate. The female characters in particular are ill-served---whether a crusading lawyer or politician or mistress---come off as either overly shrill or whiny, whereas no-nonsense street-wise savvy and seductiveness are non-existent. The males do not get off unscathed either, lacking in depth. Scenes of meetings with other mobsters have groups of guys trying real hard to LOOK tough and mean like movie standees trying to exude explosive menace.

It gives the impression of too many writers put to work, because here, they are unable to wrap up and stow away side characters as soon as they have nothing more to contribute to the storyline, which is often.

I'm just going to break this down bit by bit<br/><br/>Casting: the hosts are bland and they don't work well together. Its just a hodge podge of celeb status in front of a teleprompter. The contestants are also bad. They feel like the annoying people that are the first to get booted out of any other game show, but its of the entire cast. The intro's to the cast are a great time to stand up and get a drink of water/ bathroom break.<br/><br/>Editing: its very rushed. Every wipeout has 3 different.camera angles real time, which takes the punch out of any slip or trip.every skit that involves editing also feels like a 6th grader with imovie was in charge. Even the minimalist yellow stick figures running through the courses is better<br/><br/>Obstacles: Yuck. The best part of the show is the obstacles, and it doesn't deliver. The regular wipeout color scheme is red, blue, and black, which makes the reboot's cyan, yellow, and magenta feel like a bollywood knockoff from first glance. The saturation of the entire show hurts your eyes, like the grass is wayyyyy too green. Lastly, the big red balls just seem cheap. Not to mention its always fun the see someone just covered in mud from the sucker-punch splat on them. You'll never see that here.<br/><br/>Episode layout: its alright. The only problem is that every episode is doubles episodes, and there's only 3 rounds instead of the usual 4.<br/><br/>Jokes: nonexistent. I mean, there is jokes, just that theyre not funny. 10 seconds in there is a \"I'm john cena\" joke, which never lands no matter who says it. The only joke that was somewhat funny was an adult joke, but it was meager.<br/><br/>All in all, there is not a single reason to watch it, especially compared to the original seasons, the hosts are better,the contestants are more memorable, the jokes and skits stick better,the interactions seem genuine, the obstacles are more interesting, so on and so forth. Heck, Nickelodeons' \"Splatalot\" is 1000x better than this dumpster heap.<br/><br/>I think the worst part of itis the feeling of what wipeout became. This is a show that my dad and i love watching,and ever since the tbs adds for the reboot have been coming up, we have just been saying how everything listed above might happen. We kept our hopes up, hoping it would be the same old \"Henson/anderson/Wagner\" feel, just with different people, but no. Corporatism. We couldnt even watch the full first round, and quit halfway through. If you want to know how the 2nd/3rd round are, refer to some other poor soul that had to watch it.<br/><br/>The best thing to do for TBS at this point is the call back the season honestly. I can't see enough people regularly watching this season to either greenlight another season or to break even on John Cena's salary for this.

The course looks slightly more difficult, but the obstacles just aren't interesting.<br/><br/>An attempt is made to highlight contestants' unique character traits, but editing is repetitive from one contestant (or pair of contestants) to the next. This makes it hard to appreciate contestants on the same level that was once possible.<br/><br/>The Hosts, John Cena and Nicole Buyer, lack cohesiveness and fail to bring the same one-two bunch brought by John Henson and John Anderson.

I'm done with all American series--NCIS, Law and Order, Bones, Criminal Minds--all of it pretentious, exploitive, escapist. The formulas soon becoming numbing--people viewing screens (that never require rebooting); scenes always ending with the central character rushing off (as if he had more important things to do); ghoulish fixation on dead bodies and body parts; hot babes and cool hunks for the groupies; repetitious lightweight musical scores. But \"George Gently\" rises above even its British rivals--Hustle, Morse, Endeavor. It's the importance of every detail, the willingness to have everything in place for a microsecond shot of ordinary citizens in their harsh environments; the characters of Gently and Bacchus and their relationship over time (we witness it through physical as well as emotional changes). Initially Inglespy is an overachieving kid who seems in over his head; Martin Shaw is a placid, stone-like, solid investigator. By the time of the last episode of Season 6 (a masterpiece of writing), Shaw has emerged as a actor of unsurpassed believability, the heart and soul of a production that rarely veers from its driving theme and purpose: the dissection of the thin line that separates love from hate, evil and irremediable pain and suffering. This series would be unthinkable on the big American networks (even PBS).

After a p*ssing contest lasting several episodes an exasperated Gently finally forces Bacchus into the boxing ring and knocks seven bells out of him,thus earning his respect and not,as you might imagine,his eternal enmity. Mr Shaw,often remembered solely for his bad hair days in \"The Professionals has matured over the years into a fine expressive and sensitive actor from \"Judge John Deed\" to \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\",his splendid voice has given gravitas to some scripts of variable merit. As Gently he retains the vestiges of a London accent that has had the rough edges knocked off it as he climbed the Met's ranks. Only the occasional lost aspirate or glottal stop cunningly inserted are giveaways that he is not the classic middle class senior detective of the era. Mr Ingleby,full of energy and aggression,keen to make a name for himself and climb the slippery pole,is just right as the junior detective as chancer:one eye open to give his guv'nor a good impression. The latest series started Sunday night with a rare excursion into the pop culture of the mid 1960s. A schoolgirl is found murdered and Gently's investigations gradually unravel the secret lives of a group of pupils and teachers. There was a brilliant,rather moving performance from Mr N.Morrisey - not,I must admit,a favourite of mine - as the Jimmy Saville figure hosting a T-T.T.V. pop show, gradually accepting that he is getting too old for the job and preparing to move reluctantly on. D.S.Bacchus is clearly going to be eternally \"on a promise\" and Gently even more brooding than before.

Granted, \"Hill Street Blues\" first came up with the large ensemble cast, the mix of humor and drama and set the stage for this program, but St. Elsewhere went so far beyond Hill Street that at the end, the two series didn't even mildly resemble each other.<br/><br/>Really, the notable thing that hooks a television viewer and a pop culture junkie about St. Elsewhere were all of the references. Almost like a game of Trivial Pursuit while you watched the action, the writers of the program constantly dropped references to other classic television programs, paid tribute to the past roles of their stars and placed all sorts of humorous \"in jokes\" for its viewers to get along the way. I don't know that all of them would still have meaning for someone viewing the show today, but maybe? The fact was the writers were letting us know that we were just like them, TV addicts, and that made a Velcro like seal between the program and its fans.<br/><br/>That was all just the sizzle. The steak was a great, solid cast and taut storytelling. Clearly this was the best show of the 1980s, and quite possibly the best hospital show in history.<br/><br/>\"First rate people in a second rate place\" was how the characters were described, and really, you can't deny it. St. Eligius had a lot of problems throughout its fifty plus years as a Boston teaching hospital, but no matter how convoluted their personal lives became, you always got the feeling that at least the doctors and nurses always cared about their patients, and that's why checking in was not just an addiction but a borderline obsession!<br/><br/>Most notable of the players were William Daniels in his role as the bombastic, pedantic and terribly Bostonian Cardiologist, Dr. Mark Craig, along with his foil, Ed Begley Jr. as his ne'er do well prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dr. Victor Ehrlich. An almost Laurel and Hardy style relationship was created with these two (though physically, perhaps Mutt &amp; Jeff is a better reference), and many of the scenes they played together were some of the most hilarious of any SITCOM of the era! <br/><br/>But it's difficult to truly single out any one acting performance, when you see who else was doctoring... future two time Oscar winner Denzel Washington on staff, Howie Mandel out of his zany stand-up style to play it straight and he managed! The elegance of Norman Lloyd as Medical Chief Auschlander, and the tragic sadness of Ed Flanders as Westphall, which, even more sadly, was echoed in his real life. Bonnie Bartlett, Christina Pickles, Sagan Lewis... a true gem of a cast and everyone contributed something amazing.<br/><br/>In addition, the guest stars list reads like a Hollywood who's who! Just check the \"episodes cast\" button if you don't believe me.<br/><br/>There were some firsts for the show: first television character to get the AIDS virus was Dr. Bobby Caldwell. Inexplicably, they also had the first character to be \"cured\" of AIDS, but the less said about that, the better! Dr. Westphall's bare ass was the first ever seen on a prime time network program. And, long before \"24\" existed, there was the digital clock on this series! <br/><br/>Forgive the final plot twist, which to me was a dig more at the network that canceled them than the fans that supported them.

The series set the formula for how future medical dramas would be produced. Physicians were not perfect individuals, and patients died. Doctors and nurses were \"real people\", and they, as did the patients, cope with day to day life inside and outside the confines of St Eligious hospital.<br/><br/>St Elswehere would bring the viewer into a drama filled hospital, where both doctors and patients interacted. The writers while giving us a look into the lives of both the Physician and patient, mercifully avoided a soap opera like atmosphere. They were instead disciplined in the intercourse between doctor and patient, and everything in between. They explored issues that TV had previously considered taboo, and handled those subjects in a mature, responsible manner, while never disregarding the intellect of the audience, and their ability to hold attention to dialogue. <br/><br/>Comparatively St Elsewhere moved on a slower pace than it's modern counterpart, \"ER\". The writers gave you scenes and story-lines that would cause the viewer to slow down and think, and avoided fast paced vacuous imagery and verbiage. Rarely did their ER blow-up, or the hospital fall victim to a helicopter crash. While there were expeditious Emergency Room exhibits in the St Elsewhere series, they did not bounce back and forth the camera like a ping-pong in an attempt to keep us amused. Instead, they focused on dialogue, the characters, and most imortant the plot.<br/><br/>Its drama along with real and diverse characters, will ensure its place in history, as one of televisions best series.

It is truly one of the finest dramas on television today even in syndication. ER could learn a lot from watching St. Elsewhere. Too bad, ER's stars are ruining their own show.

The institution had acquired its unfortunate nickname from statements made by doctors at other institutions to the effect that, if patients could not afford treatment in a respectable hospital, they would have to go to \"St. Elsewhere.\" Nevertheless, St. Eligius consistently showed itself to be a place full of concerned and highly skilled medical personnel.<br/><br/>The central character was Donald Westphall, the chief of medicine and also the one in charge of the new residents who came in every year (St. Eligius was, among other things, a noted teaching hospital). He was depicted primarily as a caring, understanding, and reserved (even repressed) individual, but he could also be seen slugging it out occasionally with the administration, his residents, and even his colleagues if the situation required it<br/><br/>The other two \"old-timers\" who were present throughout the run of the series were Daniel Auschlander, the chief of services, who had already been diagnosed with cancer in the first episode but wouldn't seem to die (though he certainly talked about dying enough) and Mark Craig, the brilliant and extremely pompous heart surgeon who always said exactly what was on his mind to everyone, regardless of the reaction it got. Craig`s favorite target by far was young Victor Ehrlich, a tall, blonde California surfer dude who also happened to be a skilled surgeon. Ehrlich, though, was content to good-naturedly absorb the barrage of insults as best he could and go on learning from the master. (Ehrlich, unfortunately, was only slightly more adept than his mentor in interpersonal relations, and his conversations with other residents frequently ended with them telling him, \"You're a pig, Ehrlich,\" and walking off.)<br/><br/>Other main characters in the sizeable cast included people every part of the hospital, from the residents to the regulars at the nurse's stations to people in custodial services to patients to administrators. As in real life, doctors came and went every couple of years, with some making greater impact than others. Indeed, the \"star\" of the series, David Birney, was gone after a single season. (It should be noted that, though the bulk of the hospital staff consisted of men, there were also women in highly visible and well-thought out roles as well, or were at times anyway.)<br/><br/>\"St. Elsewhere\" was much more soap opera-like than \"Hill Street Blues,\" and this effectively drew viewers in and kept them in year after year. In the last seasons, there were radical changes in plotline (the hospital was bought by a large corporation, which brought with it brand-new management styles), and the cast seemed to change more frequently. There were also more episodes that tried to stretch beyond the established formula of the series. One flashback episode, for example, showed the young resident Mark Craig sucking up to HIS mentor, which was a delight to watch. The final episode proved to be the most strange and surreal, and left most longtime viewers dumbfounded.<br/><br/>For me, the series was marred slightly by that fact that, as in previous series created by Bruce Paltrow (\"Lou Grant\" and \"The White Shadow\"), the producer's politics too often became an integral part of the series. In practically every episode, it seemed, there would be a conversation between a doctor and a patient`s relative in which the latter would inform the physician about the percentage of Americans affected by some unfair law, or the exact number of cases of such-and-such a societal problem that were reported in the previous four fiscal years. The intent was good; had it occurred less frequently, it would have been far less annoying.<br/><br/>When it appears in syndication, \"St. Elsewhere\" can easily become an addiction, even if you have seen episodes three or four times already. The writing was at a very high level, the characterizations were three-dimensional and complex, and the medical situations intriguing. One becomes very interested in how the characters deal with their problems, and what twists and turns their lives will take. There is sufficient comedy mixed in with the serious plots to allow the easing of your pain after serious conflicts have arisen, and there are even some inside TV jokes thrown in once in a while for those who can catch them. Yes, there is far too much melodrama sometimes, but even that can be fun.<br/><br/>(\"St. Elsewhere\" is often mentioned in the same breath with \"Hill Street Blues.\" They were both hour-long, big-cast dramas of the 1980s, both with several plots going on at the same time, both were made by the same production company, and both were part of the \"revitalization\" of NBC, which by the end of the decade was not at all the \"joke\" network it had been ten years before. \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Hill Street Blues\" were fine programs, though \"Hill Street\" was easily the best drama of the decade.)", "rating": null, "helpful": "18 out of 21 found this helpful.", "date": "11 May 2000"}, {"title": " Addictive", "content": "This show was one of my favourite all-time American TV dramas.

Even the characters I loved to hate were important to me. The greatest creative works, from ancient Greek tragedy to the best of TV and movies, make you care about the characters. So when it was announced that St. Elsewhere was ending with a special episode that would tie up the plot lines, I was eager to learn what would happen to these people who had meant so much to me for so long.<br/><br/>Of the many story threads in that final show, I now remember only two. In the first, a hefty operatic soprano is brought into the ER with laryngitis before a performance. This gimmick was so obvious that it would have been barely laughable except that it signaled us in advance how we were to know that the show was over, and the anticipation made the plot trick work. When the fat lady sang, it was funny and we knew it was THE END.<br/><br/>Except it wasn't. The camera drew back to show the exterior of the hospital in a snowstorm, then the picture faded to the swirling interior of a snow globe containing the tiny shape of the St. Elsewhere building. We saw that the globe was being shaken by a child we recognized as the mute, autistic son of one of the hospital's doctors. But then we found that the boy's father was not a doctor at all but a blue-collar guy, and his grandfather was the \"real life\" version of yet another of the hospital's doctors. So the show's writers were telling us that the entire series was not just imaginary but the product of the imagination of a tragically damaged mind.<br/><br/>I was outraged and I am still fuming all these years later. I felt that I was being made a fool of for having cared for these characters. Of course, at one level they ARE imaginary since they are all fictional. But for the show's creators to take the characters that we were led to care about so strongly and reduce them to dreams or hallucinations was like a slap in the face to me.<br/><br/>I disagree with the poster who compared the St. Elsewhere ending with that of \"Newhart\".

I don't mind that bits and pieces are borrowed from \"The Prisoner,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Cube,\" \"The Village,\" \"Dark City,\" \"Twin Peaks,\" \"Persons Unknown,\" and a bunch of other movies and TV shows, but to come up with something like this is quite irritating. However, before I get to the plot, I want to mention that the often cardboard acting is a problem here, because the plot can't keep your mind off of it. I'm particularly disappointed in Matt Dillon's performance - it often feels like they gave the lead role to someone who can't do more than be a background character actor! Better acting for his role might have helped quite a bit, at least until the level of silliness became clear.<br/><br/>As to the plot, it's just ludicrous, but it would have at least made more sense to say that people decided to experiment with genetic manipulation to create \"super humans,\" but a small group was kept to be the old type humans, just in case something went terribly wrong, which in fact would have to happen for it to play out in a similar way. The worst thing here, beyond super humans who can violate the laws of physics, is the idea that teenagers are the psychologically strong ones and can keep secrets! Wouldn't you tell the adults first, because they would want to ensure that their children are protected and can live a reasonably good life? Don't parents tell their children about the \"hard realities of life\" most of the time? How did that get reversed?

Yes, what a wonderful way to preserve good old American values! And if you are a species on the verge of extinction, why are you executing members who just want to know the truth or speak their minds? Unless this all turns out to be someone's nightmare, I can't see how this is going to hold any water. It's ridiculous on multiple levels - scientific, social, psychological, and technological.

Did the writers FINISH 1st grade? Adequate acting &amp; photography, terrible train wreck writing. Ripped off from \"In the Year 2889\"", "content": "********MAJOR SPOILERS!********<br/><br/>Hello!<br/><br/>This is a difficult review to write. While, as others have pointed out, the acting mostly varies from adequate to very good (the standouts being Juliette Lewis and Melissa Leo), with decent photography and direction, the total end results are closer to a train wreck than a TV series. (I haven't read the books, but many have indicated that the series is reasonably close, so many of these comments will apply to the author and books.)<br/><br/>The series started out promising. A strange town, a mystery. As others mentioned, a combination of \"The Prisoner\", \"Twin Peaks\", and \"Lost\". Quickly, I (having read thousands of science fiction books), knew it would be one of three explanations: 1. suspended animation, 2. time travel, or the long shot, aliens. Several episodes later, guess what?- 2,000 years of suspended animation.<br/><br/>Soon I realized that much of this was simply ripped off from 1967's movie, \"In the Year 2889\". Mad scientist figures out the end of the world's coming, saving select people in a small valley with cliffs on 3 sides that the cannibalistic mutant humans with huge pointy teeth, can't get down. Model of the entire valley, talk of procreation, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Nowhere in this series do ANY of the characters in the town of Wayward Pines, act rationally, sane, or use logic in the slightest manner. I could list more than 100 irrational, idiotic things the characters did, given the situation, but there isn't nearly enough room.<br/><br/>Ummm... where is the food coming from? ...the cars? ...the houses? ...the electricity?<br/><br/>Some people defend this, saying it's all from immense storage areas inside the mountain. (It would have to be! There are no crops, no factories, no livestock.)<br/><br/>Ummm... how would you like a nice, heaping dish, of 2,000 year old ice cream? (Big favorite of the sheriff.) What about a nice dish of 2,000 year old cereal, with 2,000 year old milk? Running cars on 2,000 year old gasoline (gasoline's octane drops so low after 7 years, it won't run cars). Where do you buy those tires today, with that 2,000 year warranty? I'd like a set!<br/><br/>Ludicrous, ridiculous! Did the incompetent writers think ANY plot point in this entire story, through in the slightest?<br/><br/>Imagine this, if you would. Mad scientist billionaire sets this all up. Freezes everyone he's kidnapped over more than a decade. Freezes food. Now, ALL of this equipment has to run perfectly, without repair for 2,000 years, and automatically wake them up! How many items manufactured TODAY, will still be working even 20 years from now, let alone 2,000 years! WHERE is the power coming from, to run all of this power hungry equipment? Idiotic!<br/><br/>Most of these problems could've been avoided by using an old science fiction idea, a \"stasis field\", where time stops inside (seen in the TV show, \"Red Dwarf\"), where everything could have been stored.<br/><br/>The mad \"scientist\" billionaire, a biologist, who has set this all up, thinks nothing of having regular executions (murders, really), for the tiniest of offenses, in a town where no one knows it's 2,000 years in the future, with terrible monsters outside the electric fence! Though they don't know it, they are living on stores that won't last forever.<br/><br/>Ummm... wouldn't it make slightly more sense, to be figuring out a way to clear the monsters out of an area so that you could farm, and start building factories, BEFORE your storehouse runs out, and everyone starves to death? Instead of wasting a bunch of people monitoring everyone's tiniest move in town, and going through all of your limited stores? And setting everyone at each others throats bloodily demanding executions for the smallest, most insignificant infractions?<br/><br/>The rational for this, is that in the first incarnation of the town, when the residents were informed of the real situation, they began committing mass suicide. Hogwash! In wartime, when cities were bombed into rubble (a similar kind of psychological shock), no such thing happened.<br/><br/>And being a biologist, he should CERTAINLY know, that the gene pool here is already almost too small to continue the human race. Each execution, POOF!, those genes are gone forever from the gene pool. Obviously, he should have frozen sperm, to guarantee genetic diversity over the coming generations, but somehow this simple thought eluded him (though I doubt that 2,000 year old frozen sperm would be any more viable than 2,000 year old frozen humans).<br/><br/>And THEN, he decides to kill off the entire town, because they've displeased him, and defrost a third group, to try again. Madness! Irrational! Bad, stupid, stupid, stupid writing.<br/><br/>I've saved the worst bit for last, the creatures, the \"abbies\". The creatures are supposedly mutated humans. The writers obviously don't have the slightest clue what a mutation is, or how they happen (randomly and incrementally), or what is required for the mutation to become widespread (advantages over their predecessors in a given environment).<br/><br/>Believe me, if \"abbies\" suddenly started being born everywhere (something that can't happen), they would overwhelmingly be killed at birth. They would not take over the planet, and kill all the normal humans. Again, bad, stupid writing.<br/><br/>Also, they can't survive as depicted. Apparently 100% males (ummm, how do they procreate?) Naked, without clothing, in IDAHO??? I don't think so! Hundreds of them, constantly, in tiny areas? WHAT do they eat? They would die out rapidly from starvation after clearing out an area of game.<br/><br/>There is a partial fix for this stupidity. That the creatures were a result of genetically modifying humans to create super-soldiers, and used in a war. Simultaneously, a biological weapon wipes out regular humans, leaving the creatures unscathed. (NOT original ideas.) But the ignorant writers didn't write this, or anything resembling competent writing, of course.<br/><br/>Garbage, drivel, terrible, waste of time.<br/><br/>You've been warned!<br/><br/>Karl<br/><br/>********MAJOR SPOILERS!********", "rating": 1, "helpful": "158 out of 235 found this helpful.", "date": "28 July 2015"}, {"title": " Interesting but a pity.......", "content": "This a weird show from the outset but, even after reading the books, is never predictable.<br/><br/>Nurse Pam is the first resident Ethan meets upon waking in Wayward Pines hospital, after a car crash.

I hoped for many things, but certainly not that holey, stupid thing that some people are referring to as a plot. Because. What?! Are they serious? This is ridiculous and unbelievable on so many levels that I can't even...<br/><br/>Well, many other reviewers already described what's wrong with this show (possibly more coherent than me, too\u2014but it's 3:45 am, I'm very possibly suffering from sleep deprivation and English isn't my first language, so there's that) but I'm going to add my two-cents nevertheless.<br/><br/>This was illogical and irrational, to say the least! And I'm only at episode 6.

Or the \"devolution\" of the human race to these savage, super-strong aberrations, monsters, that lurk &amp; live like brain-dead, naked beasts in the woods. And they don't only survive by killing big game with their pointy teeth and sharp claws, eating raw flesh\u2014bye-bye fire and cooking, medicine, technology, even houses..\u2014but manage to be at the very top of the food chain and are now the biggest threat to human kind.<br/><br/>Yeah. Human kind is devolving into those things and we are meant to believe that\u2014while they so obviously lost all of human ingenuity and are a step down in the evolution\u2014they are superior to humans? Are responsible for the almost-extinction of men? Don't get me wrong, I don't believe that humans are at the shiny tippytop of evolution (ever), but what I am certain of is that these creatures would definitely not win against human (nuclear) weaponry. But that is only the very start of what's wrong with this series!<br/><br/>We have hibernating human beings that are being woken up thousands (!!) of years in the future (in 4028) to live \"happily\" in Wayward Pines to ensure the survival of the human race. Unbeknownst to the residents of this lovely small town, of course. Because they are kept in the dark about everything that matters. All they know is that they've been abducted (in the 21st century, which is still the century they're living in as far as they're concerned) and are now kept prisoner in a town in which everybody's forced to put up a happy front and silently obey some stupid rules (let's sum them up as \"don't-ask-don't-tell\") or be publicly executed.<br/><br/>Instead of telling people the truth about anything they're executed for spray-painting walls! Very logical, especially when every human being and their genes are so very important for ensuring the survival of the human race! <br/><br/>But what is even worse and more unbelievable is the fact that all adults are supposedly too weak to stomach the harsh truth, whereas teenagers and children are not. The so-called adolescent \"first generation\" is taught about the creatures and everything at school and they're forbidden from repeating anything to their parents. Because adults can't handle it, will kill themselves rather than live in a world in which humans are almost extinct. Teenagers, though, are supposedly resilient, and are equipped to not only handle the truth but to do so on their own while lying to their own parents about it all.<br/><br/>Why some adults (like the teacher or the scientist and his sister who build Wayward Pines and ALL THE OTHER 200ish PEOPLE WHO SECRETLY ENSURE THE WORKS of Wayward Pines) are capable of living with full knowledge of the truth, despite \u0084being of age\" without trying to commit (mass)suicide is not explained, though\u0085<br/><br/>It's quite a mystery as well where the lovely residents of Wayward Pines get their supplies like food and electricity etc. from. There's, after all, only so much that 200 behind-the-scenes people living in a secret facility can do without ever venturing outside, or anywhere. Or are we supposed to believe that these handful of people are (stock) farmers, scientists, electricians, and so on,who manage to solely ensure that the unsuspecting people of last-town-on-earth don't lack anything material like food, clothes, houses, toiletries and all the different stuff that they're accustomed to from before?<br/><br/>Or are they pulling all these supplies out of their asses? Or did they \"deepfrost\" these supplies as well? If so, is no-one concerned with them inevitably running out of these supplies at one point? Wouldn't it be much smarter to have the townspeople learn how to grow crop and so on instead of playing \"real-estate agent\"?<br/><br/>There are so many glaring plot holes I can't even begin to list them all in this review! <br/><br/>Have only a handful of Americans been deemed worthy enough to ensure the survival of the human race? Genetic diversity, anyone?? Have the writers ever heard of the word gene pool or do they have any idea at all how evolution and mutation work? Did they have biology at all in school? One can only guess. And, as far as I'm concerned, this guess isn't really in their favour, to be honest.<br/><br/>Well, I'm deeply disappointed by this series, which actually started out rather promising.

It is groundbreaking and it does deal with topics rarely seen on the small screen. But leaving behind its envelope pushing and taking it simply as a drama (it's not a comedy at all, even though it won in the Comedy category), Transparent fails on a number of levels.<br/><br/>Series creator and writer Jill Soloway missteps by populating the story with an assortment of aggravating characters, particularly the three grown children of Maura Pfefferman, the transgender father played by Jeffrey Tambor. These three whining ninnies are thoroughly unlikable and annoying. Scratch that - they're reprehensible. It may have been Soloway's intention to present a flawed family, but she forgot to give the kids a single redeeming quality. Eldest daughter Sarah (Amy Landecker) is an upper, upper middle class soccer mom with a stable husband and two kids who suddenly chucks it all one fine day to pursue her repressed lesbianism with a butch flame from her college years, only to decide a short time later that the the gal-on-gal lifestyle may not be her thing after all. Son Josh (Jay Duplass) is a sleazy, well-to-do record company manager who sleeps with lots of young groupie types and impregnates a bubbleheaded chanteuse, but who really gets off on old ladies. Then there's la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the irritating threesome, youngest sibling Ali (Gaby Hoffman), an unemployed nymphomaniac who vacillates between bedding black men, a kinky female-to-male lover, and maybe - just maybe - her best girlfriend who's also sleeping with her hyper-sexed brother. You want to smack all of these kids, but it's Ali you really want to hit over and over again.<br/><br/>Then there's the story. While Maura's struggles with accepting her female gender identity should be Transparent's focus, they take a backseat to the insignificant, and at times, completely implausible, trials and tribulations of the Terrible Trio. Maura's coming out to her children barely registers with them. They practically acknowledge it in passing, then go back to their petty navel gazing. So instead of watching a show about a man who becomes a woman, we watch a show about selfish adults who just happen to have a transgender parent that shows up occasionally to give them money. Only when the focus is on Maura, her small circle of friends, her explorations of her new world, and the humiliation she sometimes faces as an out transgender woman does Transparent feel authentic and moving. Sadly, these moments are few.<br/><br/>Finally, Soloway's writing is mediocre at best. The dialogue among the characters is frequently stilted, and there appear to be many improvised moments that the actors simply fumble. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention Melora Hardin's performance as Sarah's masculine partner Tammy. Hardin plays her as an over the top caricature, slouched forward, legs in a constant wide stance, fingers hooked into her blue jean belt loops. It's unintentionally comical and cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Transparent does has some noteworthy performances. Jeffrey Tambor brings the right balance of wonder, joy, fear, and world weariness to Maura, and he is every bit deserving of his Golden Globe nod. Bradley Whitford does a surprising and effective turn as Maura's secret transvestite friend Marcy, and Alexandra Billings, as Davina, Maura's transgender confidante, is superb. Judith Light brings nice comic relief to the proceedings as Maura's ex-wife Shelly, but she's completely under-utilized.<br/><br/>All this talent, however, can't overcome the weak script and unsympathetic characters.

The spectator will find every kind of clich\u00e9d imaginable out of bourgeoisie delusions' about how gender is \"constructed\", often taken straight from John Money's theories and experiments and philosophers' such as Foucault. It really bothers me when the political affiliation of the writer is so evident that I can identify the political intention she had in mind when writing any given character. Writing should come from your guts, a great writer once said, otherwise it's phony. Writing shouldn't conform to you political sympathies or your inner guilt for having had a middle-class upbringing.

To summarize, that's what bothers me the most on this show: every character line was written in such a way that they seem lifeless, they seem to be puppets that conform to the way the writer imagined the world to function.

I had to watch several episodes before I finally decided I had to continue watching. And I can now say I am certainly glad I did so.<br/><br/>This is a very socially-aware and responsible television show. In this age of equality movements and acceptance of everybody regardless of their traits, this show takes a bold step in the right direction. It is able to place the viewer in the shoes of those we likely never have before and we are able to feel empathy towards these characters - as we should, after all, we are all human beings. This is what this show highlights: although we may find ways to divide ourselves (by race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, etc.) we are inextricably connected. No matter how much we may want to differentiate ourselves from certain people, we cannot ever possibly hope to believe that we are in fact entirely different. That is the magnificence of the human condition: whilst we are all the same, we are all unique at the same time. The creators of this series are very well aware of this and productively harness this concept and utilise it in the development of each episode.<br/><br/>I have to ask: can this family get any more unorthodox? With a transgender father, an anxious wreck of a mother, a bisexual daughter, a tomboy/curious daughter (soon to be something more?), and a love-obsessed son (who has his own son, funnily enough), I'm really not sure it can. However, as I have quickly observed, despite their peculiarity, they are - in a strange sort of way - indeed very human with very human emotions and problems. And this is what makes them relatable. This is what allows us to empathise with them and gain an understanding and perspective of their lives. We are able to see past the undeniable differences we have and connect with these characters. And this is all thanks to the hard work of Jill Soloway, the creator, and everyone else involved in making this series.<br/><br/>My one criticism is that despite this show being categorised as a comedy series, it is not very funny - certainly not the first few episodes anyway. Of course, it has its moments and I'm not denying the fact that I've laughed at it before. I'm merely stating that the comedy doesn't seem to be secondary (which would be acceptable), it almost seems tertiary - as if it's just an added extra. I didn't mind this too much as the story is alluring enough for myself; however, some who may come to try this series will do so solely because it is categorised as comedy. And I do believe those people will be very disappointed in what they watch. In order to justify its place in this genre, season two must try harder to incorporate comedy into each episode.<br/><br/>All in all, I am highly satisfied with this series. I can confidently state that no other show that I have ever watched before has been so bold - and I commend it for that.

The show follows the Watterson family, mainly Gumball and his adopted brother Darwin, and their misadventures.<br/><br/>You got Richard, a lazy stay at home dad with good intentions but small intellect.

And their sister Anais who is a child prodigy at four years old. Together they get into all sorts of unbelievable situations around their house, school, or city in general.<br/><br/>What I find really appealing about this show are the characters. Each character has a different animation style. One character can be traditionally animated but another can be done in CGI. And another could be a puppet. And another could be an 8-bit video game character. They all have individual character traits and it's really interesting to see all these animation styles really blend together.<br/><br/>The family is pretty close to real life too.

It's a children's show that somehow reaches older ages as well.<br/><br/>Characters are created in many ways, such as traditional animation, Claymation, stop-motion, CGI, pixilation, and even puppets. They're inspired from everyday thing, too. As an example, the burglar is a walking fingerprint. Then you have a variety of personalities, such as Mr. Small, the school counselor that's a hippy; Mrs. Simian, the ancient, ill-tempered monkey that is a teacher; a CGI tyrannosaurus rex named Tina; a peanut with antlers named Penny. The list is endless and new things are being discovered in every episode, whether they are costars or hidden in the background. Everything about the setting is lovable.<br/><br/>The family is quite clich\u00e9, however, but they manage to be clich\u00e9 in a new way. Richard, the father, is a gluttonous, pink rabbit that does nothing but sleep, unless his wife Nicole says otherwise. Speaking of Nicole, the blue cat, she's a workaholic that will blow up on someone at any given moment. She's a freakishly amazing mother. Her ways of doing things for her kids is something that's not seen very often in the real world, so although she's fantastical, her views are good. Gumball, the protagonist, is always getting into trouble with his walking-fish-adopted-brother named Darwin(an ongoing mystery to the series: Where did Darwin come from?). Their troubles are usually accidental and good-natured. Think of the Apple Dumpling Gang. Darwin is the one that usually has moral views and wants to do what's right, whereas Gumball wants the same result but reaches it in a more troublesome way. He often talks Darwin into helping him achieve his goals. Finally, you have Anise, the youngest of the family and for some reason, the smartest. She has a scientific explanation for everything that her \"dumb\" brothers can't understand.<br/><br/>The show has a lot of slapstick humor. As an example, Gumball was calling someone, and the screen split into two to show the ends of the line. The camera zoomed in on the one Gumball was calling, but as it did this, his side of the screen got bigger and bigger until Gumball was crushed on his end, morphing his face into a goofy-looking thing.<br/><br/>But you have to listen to the dialogue, for jokes are hidden in almost every sentence, whether they be hilarious or simple tings that make you smile. Dialogue helped make this show as funny as it is.<br/><br/>The show ha made several references to other things as well. There was a scene where Gumball is fighting his brother, Darwin, but they've become pixelated and are jumping into the air with robotic moves. It was spoof off Mortal Kombat. Again, the dialogue related to it. One episode, called The Sweaters, brought new characters in, dressed like teenagers from the eighties. They sported big, colorful glasses, leg warmers, and sweaters. And their hair... Eighties-style music can be heard at the end.<br/><br/>The show is unbelievably cute at times as well as so funny that my parents have even laughed at it. One scene showed Gumball losing his clothes, and in place to cover the special spots, was that pixelated box that shifts and changes color with movement. It's not raunchy or anything. Nothing that should scar kids or offend parents. But sometimes scenes are cute wonderful and heart-touching.<br/><br/>It's rare that an awful moment has appeared in the show, but they have happened. However, any show can have those. This show easily outweighs the bad with all it's humor and goodness.<br/><br/>I think the shows Uncle Grandpa and Steven Universe have tried to embrace the hilarity that Gumball wields, but those shows are too weird to understand and the humor is minimal or uncreative. Gumball also doesn't feature creepiness like Adventure Time and Regular Show, although those are popular, for what I don't know.

What started as a charming project between the UK and America that was rough around the edges eventually blossomed into a show that is on the same league as the above mentioned shows.<br/><br/>Helmed by former in-house development artist Ben Bocquelet, Gumball chronicles the escapades of the titular blue cat, Gumball Watterson, and his chaotic yet still close-knit family; pet-goldfish-turned-brother Darwin, child prodigy youngest sister Anais, overbearing and overworked mother Nicole and deadbeat, stay-at-home father Richard. They're admittedly character archetypes that we've seen many times in the past, but the way these archetypes are played with is what makes them truly memorable.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the most obvious draw to the show is its art style, which is undoubtedly one of the most creative in recent memory. It's a hodgepodge of individual styles put together (hand-drawn, claymation, 8-bit, stop-motion, live-action, CGI, puppets, and so forth) to create the vibrant and illustrious town of Elmore, the show's setting, as well as the vastly diverse cast of characters. And in an odd yet refreshing way, these styles manage to compliment each other and not look like a slapdash college project.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, Elmore is inhabited by a very charming ensemble with their own separate quirks to distinguish themselves from each other. This is aided by the fact that many of them get their own time in the spotlight as opposed to just being an afterthought.<br/><br/>Gumball's comedy is the deal-breaker here. Is it funny? Yes. Yes, it is. As is the standard fare for Western Animation, the humor has something for every age bracket. The show still retains a family-oriented atmosphere, but it's not afraid to throw in the occasional joke that flies over kids' heads but adults will completely understand. Season 2's \"The Job\" and \"The Storm\" have two fantastic examples that I'll let you see for yourself; it's too good to just tell you.<br/><br/>Bolstering the humor are the solid writing and voice work. Jacob Hopkins (Gumball) and Terrell Ransem Jr. (Darwin), and their predecessors before them, Logan Grove and Kwesi Boyake, bring the youthful energy that you can expect from their characters' ages. The rest of the main cast (Teresa Gallagher as Nicole, Kyla Rae Kowaleski as Anais and Dan Russell as Richard) also do a bang-up job with their roles.<br/><br/>Now, when I say that the show was initially rough around the edges, that applies more to the first season, which was definitely a good outing for Mr. Bocquelet. However, it's set back by some tired and quite frankly annoying characterization, mainly from the protagonist, Gumball. Depending on the writer, he's either helplessly idiotic, not-as-idiotic but still something of a loser, or an outright punching bag, physically and emotionally. Not helped is the frequency of mean-spirited episodes in the first season such as \"The Gi\", \"The Robot\" and (arguably) \"The Curse\", or episodes with mind-numbing plots like \"The Picnic\" and \"The Genius\".<br/><br/>And that's not to say that the rest of Elmore leaves scott-free. Elmore as a whole is usually the biggest contributor to the mean-spiritedness that I mentioned. Richard Watterson, however, is arguably the worst of them all. He's more or less Homer Simpson if he were an overgrown pink bunny rabbit, except with NONE of Homer's endearing qualities.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the second season on-wards have seen a tremendous improvement in the show's quality, the writing more competent, the characters more consistent, the plots more engaging and mature, and the art style cleaner. And the show has only seen improvement since then.<br/><br/>The point about the art style is kind of subjective in the fandom. A handful of fans preferred the less-defined, less-shadowed and swifter animation from season one, which gave it a rugged appeal, while another school of thought prefer the subsequent 'cleaner' style with more defined shapes, thicker lines, shadows and slower, slightly-stilted movement. I personally go with the latter.<br/><br/>And that is all I have to say about The Amazing World of Gumball. It's an amazing (redundancy not intended) cartoon series that will appeal to a wide demographic much like its contemporaries and predecessors before them, thanks to its writing, its art and its characters. As of late, I actually hold both Gumball and Steven Universe in higher regard than any other show in Cartoon Network's new line-up, and that includes the other two powerhouses Adventure Time and Regular Show.<br/><br/>For new viewers getting into Gumball, I'd recommend the following: \"The Painting\", \"The Meddler\", \"The Job\", \"The Third\" <br/><br/>This show gets a ten out of ten from me, and damn right is it deserving of it.<br/><br/>Thank you, Ben Bocquelet, for this marvel of a show, and thank you, Cartoon Network, for your continued support of the show.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "27 out of 33 found this helpful.", "date": "24 May 2016"}, {"title": " Funniest Show On Cartoon Network", "content": "I saw the commercial for this show, and was hoping it wasn't going to turn out like Secret Mountain Fort Awesome or Problem Solverz.

They also have an adopted son Darwin Watterson (formerly a pet fish). Gumball and Darwin will always put a smile on peoples faces with their wild antics and craziness. It is very easy to find things funny in this series.

However, with the recent uprising of Regular Show, Adventure Time and The Amazing World of Gumball, I thought it's best to review the third show that, according to some people, saved the network. <br/><br/>The setting for starters is actually pretty clich\u00e9. It takes mostly things from The Simpsons and doesn't really change it around. Anyway, other IMDb users have pointed out this flaw already so I can't say much. However, the humour in Gumball in general is actually funny. In my opinion, it is a wide array of humour, like abuse humour in Season 1, Slapstick from Season 2-present, social commentary in Seasons 3-present and random-but-actually- makes-sense-in-the-whole-storyline jokes from Season 2-present. <br/><br/>The writing is actually quite good, with episodes about Gumball going through a rerun of the episode and the Universe collapsing on itself just because Richard got a job. This means that Gumball writers are good especially when they find out different ways to break the fourth wall. They can also do heartwarming episodes such as The Choices and The Origins Part 1 and 2, but even though it's heartwarming and supposed to be serious, the writers manage to add jokes that are actually funny.<br/><br/>The characters. This family started out clich\u00e9, but due to all the events that have happened to them over the course of 5 seasons, obviously they will have some character development. Anais is now more involved with the family, as opposed to Season 1 where she got little screen time, Richard has been shown to generally care for his kids and Gumball and Darwin resolve their conflicts even more in more ways and sends a good message to me in my opinion. <br/><br/>So I have talked about good things. Why do I not rate this a 10/10? The reason is because some of the Gumball episodes such as The Girlfriend, The Apprentice and The Boombox are all the worst examples of a character not deserving what they got in my opinion (Darwin should have been given an apology by Jamie in The Girlfriend, Gumball should have had a good relationship with Patrick Fitzgerald in The Apprentice and Juke should have been able to speak English in The Boombox). However, 1. Some people might like those episodes 2. You can't make every episode of a show good and like it. <br/><br/>So with that in mind, I give Gumball a 9.8/10", "rating": 10, "helpful": "5 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "12 July 2017"}, {"title": " The Best Animated Series in YEARS!!!", "content": "I'll be honest before I saw this Series I think The Amazing World of Gumball was a awful show with bad animation, but one day a Friend tell me to saw The Amazing World of Gumball so I accepted, we saw an episode call \"The Vacations\" I really like the episode it has good humor and jokes for kids and adults alike, then one day by my self I saw another episode (I cant remember the name) about like a virus of joy that infected the School, then my friend come back and we saw with my brother (that think bad about the show as me) an episode called \"The Remote\" I really like the episode it was funny.<br/><br/>Then my brother and I started watching on Cartoon Network The Amazing World of Gumball.<br/><br/>The Series is about a 12 year old cat named Gumball and his brother a 11 year old Fish Named Darwin living their daily things like going to school, playing with his friends and other things.

There is trash like Problem Solvers, Mad and especially Johnny Test(Ben 10: Omniverse is not quite as bad but an example of a great franchise going a huge step backwards), but there are also gems like Regular Show and Adventure Time. While it's not without its faults The Amazing World of Gumball is one of Cartoon Network's better shows. In the earlier episodes especially, some jokes do fall flat due to either not being funny or having bad(rushed and drawn out, starting and ending too early or late) timing, and there are a few tired story lines here and there.<br/><br/>On the most part however, The Amazing World of Gumball is a very good show that has gotten better overtime and has potential to grow even more given the chance. The selling points are the animation, music and characters. The animation is colourful and wonderfully surreal, the mix of traditional, CGI, stop-motion and surreal environmental-like backgrounds make for one very unique visual style and in a good way. The music is bubbly and catchy, always memorable and enough to keep you in a good mood. The theme tune is not quite a personal favourite(populated with Hanna Barbera and 90s Disney shows admittedly), at least though it's not as cheesy as the ones for Ben 10: Omniverse and Johnny Test. The characters are admittedly clich\u00e9 but they're funny, quirky and cute and fit beautifully within the show's overall tone. Gumball is an endearing titular character, but the most memorable are Anais and especially Darwin.<br/><br/>Some have shown annoyance towards Richard and understandably, he was annoying to begin with. But once the writing got better the more easier it was for me to like him better. Besides the father figures on the Seth McFarlane shows(especially Peter Griffin on Family Guy) are far more obnoxious. Although the writing and stories for The Amazing World of Gumball haven't been consistently perfect, they still have more shining moments than utter failures. Most of the humour and writing is smart and hilarious with clever timing, while the stories have a great oddball charm and are sweet-natured and fun. The voice acting is great, the voice actors of Gumball and Darwin have such a good dynamic and should get more work. To conclude, not quite amazing but very good. It starts off a little shaky but if you stay with it it gets better, and has more potential to grow even more than it is doing.<br/><br/>8/10 Bethany Cox", "rating": 8, "helpful": "13 out of 20 found this helpful.", "date": "11 August 2013"}, {"title": " Highly Recommended!", "content": "Let's start with the voice acting. Its It's pretty good, almost all the acting for each character is a perfect fusion of their age and personality. There's a lot of characters and all of them have pretty interesting traits, and the voice actors do a pretty good job of making them convincingly sound like who they're trying to portray. I'll get back to the characters later in this review. Then there's the plot line. The best part about The Amazing World Of Gumball's plot is that it's an exaggeration of real life issues and topics, much like The Simpsons. But it does it in sort of a different way. They focus more on taking family and school matters instead. Gumball is a show about a middle schooler's misadventures with his family and friends in a strange, diverse world. It's very interesting how Gumball lives in a world that's basically an insane twist on reality. The humor of the show is executed well. It should be noted that it's almost void of any potty humor. Of course, there's some toilet and fart jokes here and there, but it's mostly self referencing jokes. You have to know what's going on and remember earlier details sometimes, but the show is very funny if you don't have a decent attention span and a somewhat sophisticated mindset. Oh, and I forgot to mention, almost all of it is relatable to almost anyone who is somewhat updated with trends and topics. Now for the characters themselves. The show does a good job of making relatable characters for almost anyone. I think almost all the characters are somewhat enjoyable, but a few are kind of annoying sometimes. Sussie, for example, is a chin girl whose only gimmick is being weird and gross, and abnormal. It's sometimes off putting. Same goes for her family. In one episode which focused on the meaning of love, her parents go on a date and disgust the whole restaurant. And Mr. and Mrs. Robinson are somewhat unlikable as well... Episodes featuring Mr. Robinson are kind of like episodes of Spongebob Squarepants where Squidward is annoyed by Spongebob and Patrick and ends up getting the worst treatment possible. Mrs. Robinson is pretty okay except for a recent episode, in which she commits nonstop, evil acts against everyone, and gets no punishment at all. Everyone is a victim except her. But sometimes the two get some redeeming moments. Sometimes. The character and background design is a rather interesting mix of real life, CGI, and animation. To some, it may be off putting, but anyone with an open mind can enjoy it. In conclusion, Gumball is a very great show with charming characters (mostly), interesting design, and charming plot lines.

Lately CN was failing, but with this show its proof it quickly getting a grip. The animation is spectacular and beautiful to watch. The clever blending of real backgrounds with multi dimensional characters is a fixed up version of Roger Rabbit. The set up is an interesting choice. Rather than have the main characters dazzled for the areas they're placed in, its a sitcom approach. Which at first seems rather boring and overdone. But sitcoms actually work with material that interest the audience. This a good example. Everything works in terms of the over working mother, lazy dad whose unemployed, genius sister, and two naive boys. The plots are a mix of minor things to huge problems. Its an interesting take. Although hard to explain. Initially i planned to review this show terribly for watching only one episode. But then i started watching them and was drawn in. the music is rather clever as well. The Problem: As mainly with the newer episodes, sometimes they're hit or miss. Its titled the Amazing World, and while the world is amazing, it doesn't reflect into the plots. Nothing wrong with a very good episode about a DVD or a Secret. But somethings a bit off when you have bad episodes like the Genius, Picnic, and the Sock. Although the Picnic sort of made up for it in terms of interesting visuals. I just expect more crazy plots. The posters for the show seems amazing, so why not the actual show. More crazy things happening and more locations. The show cant just center around one area and expect it to be good. But this show is in its early stages of airing. SO i truly admire this British American show. Nice to see animation from Europe as well. Just, try and be more amazing all the time.

Ilan Eshkeri's score is particularly strong. The visual storytelling is purposeful.<br/><br/>Nabhaan Rizwan as Raza and Roger Jean NSengiyumva as Dadir are revelations, Arsher Ali is a delight. Considine is his usual excellent self. The rest of the cast do a decent job.<br/><br/>Scenes are well-constructed, with nicely deployed visual details, and lines of dialogue echo across episodes in a way that generally doesn't feel contrived.<br/><br/>Alas, the plot - gripping and well-paced for the first 4 of the 6 episodes - begins to unravel a little in ep 5 and loses credibility in ep 6, squandering the impact of the series as a whole.<br/><br/>There is some emotional pay-off by the end, but nothing like what could have been achieved if chasms of credibility/motivations hadn't opened up to distract us.<br/><br/>The key deficiency is the 'surprise' identity of the identity of the perpetrator of a mass shooting. Personally, I'd guessed it, though I don't fault the writers for that. Where they fell down was in not making it plausible - at least in retrospect - that the character would behave that way.<br/><br/>It wouldn't have been hard to to do. We just needed to perceive some particular vulnerability on his part, and to spend a little more time with him so that we could understand his distress. A more developed set-up of how much Holly's fake allegations (of child abuse on his brother) affected him would also have helped.<br/><br/>SPOILER COMING<br/><br/>As it was, young Nasir Shar was never a particularly developed character. When Akash fired the gun in his flat, he wasn't being threatening. He was even laughing about the recoil. So Nasir jumping on Akash to seize control of the gun wasn't credible. From that point out, things made less and less sense.<br/><br/>Nasir phones the emergency services, but doesn't give them Akash's location and then wanders off with the gun. Some hole-patching dialogue from Gabriel (Considine) about how Nasir thought Akash was dead doesn't do enough to explain why - as someone who thought he'd just killed a friend - Nasir elects to keep the gun in his pocket.<br/><br/>Then, when (coincidence alert) he stumbles on the caf\u00e9 where Holly just happens to be, we are asked to make another huge disbelief suspension to believe Nasir was so distressed that he decided to shoot her there and then.<br/><br/>Remember, this is a young kid who's never handled a gun before, let alone pulled the trigger voluntarily.<br/><br/>Then it gets even less credible. Having shot Holly - against whom Nasir has a vague sort of fuzzy half-motivation - Nasir decides to turn mass-shooter and kill young girls and waiters and so on.<br/><br/>There was no sense at any point in the series that Nasir was either being radicalized to any real extent (beyond some misogyny against his step-mother), or that he was emotional unstable or vulnerable. And then, we are told, he turns the gun on himself. Something jihadis don't do, but mass shooters often do.<br/><br/>So, after six hours of well-structured drama about counter-terrorism, we're left with a denouement that involves a mass shooting which can't really be considered terrorism, and comes from pretty much nowhere in terms of character motivation.<br/><br/>The script tries to make a virtue of this from-nowhere precipitation of violence. But it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Gabe's \"why does anyone do anything?\" line near the end comes off as a non-credible shrug. He's in the business of anticipating and preventing terrorist attacks. He'd never shrug this off so casually.<br/><br/>And the take-out - that even if you manage to prevent major attacks by known Islamists, as Gabe and Raza have, random ones will spring up for no real reason - is a category error, playing into the \"he was just mentally ill\" excuse-making that sometimes gets put forward in the aftermath of religiously-motivated attacks.<br/><br/>The coincidenceyness of the ending (in terms of how the characters converge) feels a little lazy too, but it was the lack of proper motivation for, and credible response to, the attack that rang most false.<br/><br/>Frustratingly, both of these problems could have been fixed with some minor rewriting.<br/><br/>Nasir needed a handful of 1 to 3 minute scenes scattered through the series to give more sense of his psychology (which needn't have made his identity as the killer obvious), while the characters could more plausibly have converged on the hospital where Raza was being held and where there were lots of armed police to make Nasir feel scared.<br/><br/>Instead, as the credibility unravels, so does the tonal restraint that made the rest of the series powerful.<br/><br/>Holly's sister has a poorly-motivated on-the-nose speech to Gabe's wife Emily, in which she essentially mouths the theme of Gabe's character arc and then marches off in an inexplicable huff. All the tension between Gabe and Emily over his undercover work just dissipates as they drive off in their Saab. The reasons behind Gabe's continued involvement with the northern white supremacist types are never made clear - which is odd, since he's presented both as drawn to his old undercover life and, also, as some kind of avenging angel wreaking death and violence on the white racists he pretended to be one of.<br/><br/>So, all in all, it adds up to less than the some of its parts.

What is more, even anime fans could think of it as just another series just after watching the opening but don't be deceived by its childish appearance because you'll be missing an amazing show.<br/><br/>So what is the plot? A class of teenagers must kill their alien teacher because he wants to destroy the world. An apparently impossible duty is handed to them given that no forces of law had been able to kill him. However, the teacher and monster itself encourages them to do their best in their studies and in the killing task.<br/><br/>The attitude of the antagonist known as Koro-sense is not the only weird thing surrounding this persona, his physical appearance and sense of humour makes him a certainly flamboyant character. A 'sensei' quite different in manners to the classical mentor in science fiction stories but not less wise or lovable. <br/><br/>The students of this teacher are also characters who differ from typical ones, they are the worst students of an elite school. This means that they are the ones labelled as lazy or simply stupid and the shows succeeds not only in showing us their true selves and development into adulthood but also in giving a very realistic view on teenagers. While many series tend to show us plain teens with one remarkable trait, here I could see real people even in the less protagonist students. One of the most fascinating things about this show is how in the end you get to know all the students in the class and it is all about their story. Even if there are many great adult characters, they seem flawed compared to this group of teenagers. I insist, the depth of the characters makes it difficult to hate them since you are able to understand their position even when they are making mistakes. <br/><br/>Regarding the drawings, we again can see very idealistic drawings with characters that look like they belong to a children's show and the colours only help to convey this idea. Everything is full of colour and life in a series where the main theme is murder. The colour I think matches perfectly the antagonist friendly and joking personality as well as the didactic idea of presenting the show as a series of life lessons that young people can learn from. <br/><br/>As I mentioned previously, the opening of the show may give a kind of feeling that this show is going to be light yet the intensity of the most dramatic parts is well accompanied by songs that succeed in portraying the feelings of the characters as 'Moonlight' does.<br/><br/>The acting of the voice actors in Japanese is key to characters such as Koro-sensei with its characteristic laugh and changes in tone portraying kindness, pride and anger among other feelings. Voice also plays a significant role in Nagisa's androgynous character and Karma's menacing attitude.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really encourage teenagers, young-adults and specially teachers to give it a try but I believe Assassination Classroom deserves to be among the greatest animated series ever made so regardless of your age or race, don't miss it!", "rating": 10, "helpful": "12 out of 15 found this helpful.", "date": "30 August 2017"}, {"title": " My personal favourite anime", "content": "This anime is very underrated.

He is one of the most recognisable figures in anime; not only for his great design, but also his lovable personality: a caring and immaculate teacher, but also fussy, gluttonous and an incorrigible pervert.<br/><br/>The series' antagonists become as least as relatable. The demonic principal who created the school's authorial and ruthlessly hierarchic system and his son, the #1 student who has the others in his pocket - both of whom want to keep 3E subjugated - are intimidating in their own right, but their struggle amongst each other, the tyrannical parent who has never shown love, and the bitter son who wants to overthrow him, grants them a certain pathos. Near the end of the series their characters have nicely arced-out, to the point of becoming convincing human beings. Not in an overstated way, mind. The series does not ask us to love them, merely to understand them. The other antagonists are admittedly more one-dimensional, but then again: they are minor characters.<br/><br/>So far, the character building of \"Assassination Classroom\" is satisfying enough. The antagonists and deuteragonist (i.e. Koro-sensei) are very well developed. But there is one problem, a big one: the protagonists. Despite Koro-sensei's marketable image, the heart of the series lies with his students, and they are a mixed bag. The series revolves around their growth as students as well as human beings, but only marginally focusses on it. Of course it is difficult to keep up with twenty-eight students, and it would be harsh to demand all of them to have a breath-taking arc, but near the end of the first season, half of them is not even characterized. Where attention is given, it is done well: Nagisa, Karma and Kaede (all provided with a unique hair colour for convenience's sake) have more to them than shows and become endearing, but to the rest of the students fairly little happens, besides the establishment of one character trait: 'the one guy who is a pervert,' 'the one guy who wears glasses,' 'the one guy with the mushroom hair.'<br/><br/>Fortunately, the series has a saving grace: It is funny - really funny.<br/><br/>Humour is always a bit of a risk in anime. Take the first half of \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,\" where throwaway jokes often undermine the drama. Not so in \"Assassination Classroom,\" which manages to be touching as well as funny in a consistent way. At times it is even surprising how well the situations are handled. Two students pirating a rocket to rob the International Space Station (near the end of the second season) should have been the series jumping the shark, but the set-up and presentation are so clear and appropriate, that it all remains convincing.<br/><br/>Even if \"Assassination Classroom\" does not have a whole lot of substance, and its ultimate goal - to show the development of Koro-sensei's students - is not wholly reached, its heart certainly is in the right place. The characters are lovable, the writing is funny, and the storytelling is adept enough to pull the whole act off. Indeed, the series is like Koro-sensei: The more time you spend together, the more undesirable departing becomes.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "6 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "29 January 2019"}, {"title": " How did they do it?", "content": "How did the creators of this anime do it?

Replete with action and comedy, Assassination Classroom proves to be as entertaining as life-changing. I never realized when Korosensei became a real character for me and his words started to have a very positive impact on my mind. This might be the best anime I've seen to date, and I'm glad I watched it.<br/><br/>Assassination Classroom is packed with exciting action, hilarious comedy and at times hard-hitting emotional moments. From the first episode alone, it managed to convince me I was in for a treat. All characters, from Nagisa to Karma, managed to leave a solid impact. It's a pretty atypical action anime, given its school setting and how it even uses action sequences in a metaphorical way at times, something we don't see happening daily. The voice acting is also top-notch, especially for Korosensei, who contagious laugh becomes a character in itself.<br/><br/>It's also a perfect satire on the education system at the same time. Assassination Classroom starts and continues on a light note, only to move you by the time it ends; it became hard for me to believe it was ending, but since quality matters more than quantity, I have to praise how deftly the writers and animators handled the show. The last episode ends the show on a perfect note, without leaving you confused or feeling incomplete. That being said, this power-packed action comedy is a legit masterpiece. If possible, try avoid reading too much about it on the internet as chances of getting spoiled about certain things are pretty high.

I caught this by accident, not being an avid TV watcher - and became hooked. I'd heard a version of it on the radio - I'm not sure which came first in the order of things - but that was mildly amusing, although a lot of Miranda's comedy is visual, and when I heard a repeat of the radio version after seeing the TV show, I could see the problems they were up against. <br/><br/>Any flaws I found in the TV series - we armchair critics have to look for flaws in new things - were cancelled out by the fact that I felt better after each episode I watched. Not just amused, and in some cases, very tickled indeed, but uplifted. <br/><br/>All of the characters are attractive and likable - and despite Miranda's self-deprecating gags about being often mistaken for a man, she's a very feminine, and extremely good-looking lady. Her device of engaging directly with her home-viewing audience, via the camera, works well, and adds to her personal appeal.<br/><br/>The comedy chemistry in the scenes with her diminutive friend, Stevie, played by the also extremely good-looking and funny Sarah Hadland, creates some of the best laughs in the show.<br/><br/>Here's a thought: The last series I watched starring Patricia Hodge, who brilliantly plays Miranda's scatty mum in this, was called The Life and Loves of a She-Devil, from about 1985 (not to be confused with the later Hollywood version). In She-Devil, she played the rival of a character portrayed by another very statuesque brunette, Julie T. Wallace. I wonder if this had any influence on the decision to cast her in Miranda?<br/><br/>Perhaps a lot of this show's appeal is in it's almost childlike presentation. The cast, one by one, wave goodbye to us at the end of the episodes, like human Telly Tubbies.

Stereotypical characters run rampant on the show, but let us remember the REAL reason it lasted seven years. The show's creators knew that they had TV gold when they enlisted TV veterans Duffy (Dallas) and Sommers (Three's Company) to play the role of Mom and Dad. Now, parents of young preteens and teens could watch the show with their kids and have \"adult\" eye candy to gaze upon. One cannot discount both of their abilities as all-time television sex symbols. Nor the casting of Staci Keanan, the cute as a button girl from \"My Two Dads\". These three vets allowed for the creators to not worry about finding good writers or creative ideas, but ride the wave of the familiar faces. As for the characters, with so many kids, all stereotypes are fully represented. The \"best\" (or worst) has to go to Cody (Sasha Mitchell). He alone dropped the comedic IQ of this show from average to pathetic. His \"dude\", \"whoah\" and \"wow\" is more than 50% of his total dialouge. Although an idiot is found on nearly every sitcom post 1980, Cody may take the cake for the worst written. Besides not being a real child of the family (he's a cousin) and living in a van in the garage, Cody doesn't do much but walk in and marvel at something he finds interesting, say one of the three words, nod his head crazy, and move on. The writing/acting makes \"Bill and Ted\" (who had to help inspire the role) look like Mensa members. Keanan acts well for her part as the intelligent anti-male, with Angela Watson portraying the hot ditz with adequate flair and substance. Christine Lakin also acts well as the tomboy (AL), then Hottie in a tomboy's body in the later years. The women overcame bad writing with being gorgeous and actually acting the part they were given, knowing the roles they needed to fill. However, the guys in the show really didn't hold up to the bargain. Castille IS the biggest wimp in TV history as Mark, and Brendan (Josh Byrne) came across as nearly retarded in trying to get out his lines. Only JT (Brandon Call), the smart-witted, no common sense son actually gets what he is trying to convey as the \"this is the way it was, and will be\" attitude towards the family, as well as being a perfect beta-male in the house. I always wondered why NONE of the guys was an \"IT\" guy, like Karen the model, cheerleader-esquire character. All the guys seemed to be wimps, losers, and dorks who just could not get what they wanted. Had JT been the ladies man, Big man on campus guy, I feel the show would have added a nice dimension. Anyways, the characters in the show all live up to their strict gender roles, with Mom being a hairdresser, dad the construction man, etc. etc. Other characters came and went: JT had a perverted friend Rich (James Marsden) that Dana actually dated later, which will blow your mind if you see an early episode with Rich featured. Sommers had a sister helping cut hair, she left after season 1, Sommers decided to have MORE kids (original storyline) and at the end, Perfect Strangers alum Bronson Pinochet came in to string along another 52 weeks of paychecks for the show. I must also add that this is the one show with school-aged kids who, to my knowledge, were rarely shown actually IN school. (They did have the occasional school function, but the show was not normally set around an AT school problem) I do not doubt they went, but the show was so much more about the house, family, and their interactions. Even the Brady Bunch had some school scenes, but not on SBS. I think the viewer would have had a better understanding of characters had we see them interact with ANYONE besides their stereotypical family.<br/><br/>Re-watching this show may give you a different perspective, as previously stated this show was over-sexed and strangely written. (and I didn't notice at age 12, but age 22). The sexual overtones of this show, after watching again, is shocking. Duffy and Sommers reprise their sexual appetite from their former shows, always wanting to get the kids asleep for some fun under the covers. No show in history had more kids walking in as their parents were \"asleep\" than Step By Step. Some episodes had 5-10 minute scenes of Duffy \"begging for sex\" as Sommers contemplated one of their many kids' current problems. Their acting seemed so easy to them, I think they just acted as themselves the entire show. Other issues include a cousin, Cody, being in love with Dana (Keanan) and parents always wanting to sneak off for alone time, proving this show would not be thought of in the \"family show mold\" of 2004. I am shocked to see it on ABC Family, because the show rarely had the -aww, shucks- moments practically trademarked by ABC's TGIF. Where as Boy Meets World, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, and Family Matters seemed to always have a moral, lesson, or rule to be found, followed, and understood, Step By Step seemed to throw away any diverse message and just stuck with \"love your family, it is the only one you have\". That is a fine mantra to live by, but hardly revealing. Overall, a show with a permanent place in history considering its stars and placement as a 90's TGIF staple, and worth seeing on re-runs, just to see what television was putting in young minds from 1991-1998. 6-7 stars out of 10.", "rating": null, "helpful": "37 out of 57 found this helpful.", "date": "17 December 2004"}, {"title": " One of the all time best sit-coms", "content": "I've been watching this show since the first episode and have always loved it.

It's fun and interesting without being shallow. The focus is on the characters themselves and the personal relationships between them rather than on the events taking place. This probably makes it refreshing and exciting compared to the multitude of impersonal police and investigation drama series where viewers are only presented with the events as such and are not allowed enough access into the personal dimension of the characters. Each character is unique in their own way although they do share a common trait: humor, whether it is voluntary or not. It seems to be in their nature to treat the 'drama' in the show and in their lives with the necessary, required amount of irony and sarcasm, a fact which makes them funny and pleasant. As policemen, they do their job well, but at the end of the day they prove they are still human by going out for a drink with their friends, thinking about and analyzing the events they have just been a part of and drawing certain conclusions about themselves and life in general. Most of the times they don't allow themselves to take complex situations or difficulties too seriously although they are aware of them and the consequences these have on their lives. The characters are all 'fighters' and no matter the hardships they are faced with, they don't give into them and are prepared to start again the next day. The overall tone of the show is light-hearted but it is welcomed considering the police drama series genre. There is chemistry between the major characters and compatibility between all the characters. I do have to confess that, although at the beginning of the show I thought Andy and Luke would form a better couple than Andy and Sam, my opinion has changed since then. For me it is obvious, at the end of season 1, that Andy and Sam would form a better couple because they share a deeper level of understanding and communication. Sam is closer to Andy than Luke is and the first relates to her better than the last. I think that Andy simply needs more time to understand both of them and accept that Sam is the better option. Maybe as a viewer I would need to know more about Luke's character and to see more of his personal side and history to be able to still support his relationship with Andy. At the same time maybe we, as viewers, aren't really supposed to get a better look at Luke's character precisely because there is nothing more of interest other than the passion for his job. Either way, the fun of it all is also added by the fact that the five major characters are all rookies not only in their profession but also in their personal lives. They don't only need to 'discover' themselves but also those around them. It's going to be interesting to watch the transformations they undergo and the way they 'grow'.

It's got action, drama, and even has it's comedic moments. It has a variety of characters, the main ones being the five rookies, and chronicles the goings-on in and around the team. <br/><br/>The main characters are Andy, the good cop who rarely lets anyone in, Epstein, the smart dork from a broken family (that he never really talks about), Peck, the mean girl whose mother was a well-known and well-respected cop on the force, Diaz, the good Catholic boy who seems to want to break free of that image, and Nash, the single mother who's been trying to balance work and motherhood without anyone's help. They're all, at times, naive and still have so much to learn but isn't that what being a rookie is all about? You're trained according to what might happen but that almost never completely prepares you for the real world. <br/><br/>I think the problem many viewers have with this show is that it's been done before but, like I said , this is a cop show and that's what it's promised to be. If you know you don't like the genre, that's fine, but it isn't the show's fault. I'm venting a bit, but it's just frustrating when the advice being given is to not give the show a chance because there have been similar shows before. If you're looking for something completely different from anything you've ever seen before, you'll be looking for quite some time so, in the meantime, give this show a chance. It has real characters: ones everyone can relate to in some way or another, and the stories continue to unravel every week. Each episode has stories of their own, but there are also overarching story lines that regular viewers can become attached to. <br/><br/>It recently got renewed for a second season (Congratulations!), so it'll be around for a while. It really is a good show. The kind that I, personally, have been wanting to see but didn't expect in the summer (how often do good summer shows come on?). So, if you can, check it out.

Despite being aired on Showcase, Global and ABC, I didn't really hear too much about this show until the first season was done. With the series being filmed and set in Toronto, I was surprised it took me so long to watch it. This show might be old news to a lot of people but personally, I only know a handful of people who have seen this. So let me give a brief synopsis before getting into the review.<br/><br/>On the surface, Rookie Blue looks nothing more than a typical police drama with hardly any big name actors (No offence to Missy Peregrym and Gregory Smith) but it is so much more than that. Perhaps it holds a special place in my heart because of its Toronto and Canadian connections. The best way to describe this show is Grey's Anatomy with cops instead of surgeons. Replace the interns with rookies and Seattle Grace with 15 Division and you got yourself, Rookie Blue. The story is focused on 5 rookies (All Canadian actors btw) that just graduated from the academy, and follows their young careers as they experience the hardships of being a police officer both, on and off duty. Each rookie is assigned with a training officer and its a treat to watch the different dynamics of each pair, as well as the dynamics among the rookies as a group - learning together yet competing with one another to gain attention from the top dogs.<br/><br/>The main star of the show is rookie Andy McNally portrayed by the Montreal beauty, Missy Peregrym (Stick It), she's a cop that has a lot to prove because she carries the baggage of her father, a worn out, burnt out homicide detective. Other rookies include, over achiever, Dov Epstein (Gregory Smith, Everwood), nice-by-the-book-guy, Chris Diaz (Travis Mine), tough girl with an attitude, Gail Peck (Charlotte Sullivan), and the responsible single mother, Traci Nash (Enuka Okuma). Some of the veteran cops include, McNally's training officer, Sam Swarek (Ben Bass) - who's the direct opposite of her, goes by instinct and tends to break the rules to get the job done, homicide detective, Luke Callaghan (Eric Johnson) and Nash's training officer, Noelle Wlliams (Melanie Nicholls-King).

If it was more realistic there would be no ratings, because, lets face it... Police don't have life threatening cases every day that they're working. I'm not saying that being a police is boring, but I don't think if you followed real police around with their duties ratings will be high.

Yes, there are some unresolved issues that the creators would benefit from paying some attention to. Yes, the show can be much better than it is. Yet, that in itself is kind of inspiring, and certainly enough to keep this show around for more than one season. I would be willing to see a LOT more of it, in fact. It has so much opportunity to address so many issues with its fantastic premise. If it bobbles every once in a while like with the third, so what? It's only four episodes in. Every show's team makes mistakes sometimes. The point is whether or not they learn from their mistakes. The episode that came on after the third was infinitely better than the previous one. The lead characters seem to be having a BALL, always an important aspect of what makes a show watchable. There are a myriad of possibilities left to explore. The lead actors and actresses are excellent and perfectly cast, Mr. Sam whatchamacallit is an excellent handsome lead I promised myself I would not fawn, and Andie is a very compelling character in herself. I would prefer a voice over from her so that her behavior made more sense why be so mean to Sam because of rules that are not under his control? Why can't she just TALK to him about it? Is she actually not interested?. I would also prefer that she be a bit more approachable, and please God, better at her job. Right now she SEEMS every bit the bumbling intern, and is clearly not doing as well as everyone else. Yet that gives her the opportunity to redeem herself. Many shows begin with a much less interesting premise and get less interesting as they go along. This show is better than at least half the shows on television, including those that have somehow like a certain criminal investigation show, anyone? persisted for a good three years longer than they should have with critics' inexplicable approval. This show is fun, it is real, it is a look at a world we have only seen from the rosy point of view of the very best. We have never seen the criminal justice system deeply challenged from the inside, which Andie seems poised to do. We have never seen the rules of engagement actively challenged, which Sam seems poised to do. We have never had any writers tackle the very real problem of special treatment in selecting new candidates for the force and offering promotions. We have never seen people of different races work together and address misunderstandings, like Andie's best friend and her paramour.

It's more drama than action and anyone going in this expecting Lethal Weapon divided into episodes with lots of explosions is going to be disappointed. This show is about rookies struggling to find their way as cops. <br/><br/>Their 'growing pains' are recognisable and that's what makes it fun. All the characters have their insecurities and even the veterans have their vulnerabilities, just like in real life. After setting up the characters and the atmosphere, it starts revealing the romantic angle, which makes it a bit like the police version of Grey's Anatomy. It's a character centric show, which means the case or issues always come second and that, to me, isn't a bad thing as long as the actors pull it off.<br/><br/>And they do. The cast is led by the vibrant, likable Missy Peregrym (Andy McNally) with strong performances from Gregory Smith (Dov Epstein) and Ben Bass (Sam Swarek) among others. In the first season, you see them struggle, fall, succeed, fall in love and deal with hardships. It's never so much that you think \"man, can they dump even more on this character\" but enough to keep your attention. In the second season, you see them find their footing, only to find out that more experience doesn't necessarily make things easier and less complicated. <br/><br/>That doesn't mean the show is flawless. It isn't. Sometimes, there is lack of context to explain why a certain character is behaving the way they do. Sometimes a case gets resolved too neatly. Sometimes things are predictable. But the show's saving grace is it's heart. The characters feel genuine, which is why I've stuck with them for 2 seasons and am anticipating season 3. <br/><br/>My 8 star rating is a rating on my entertainment value scale.

Marco de la O did a great job as El Chapo. He captured the accent,the mannerisms and even resembled El Chapo so much that you could forget he was an actor playing a part. It felt like you were really seeing El Chapo. Even the clothing he wore was the same as what you see in photos and videos of El Chapo, so the attention to detail was amazing. Humberto Busto was also outstanding as the corrupt politician Conrado Sol. The actors who played former Presidents Salinas, Fox, Calderon, Pe\u00f1a Nieto and other recognizable politicians in Mexico were really good at creating their characters. Chapo's family, friends, and henchmen were also convincing in their roles. Overall, it was a believable cast and very well acted.. Almost everything that happens in the show happened in real life, so it's almost like watching a documentary.<br/><br/>The series comes down very heavy on the Mexican government and justice system, showing how corrupt everyone is. The message is clear; the drug cartels are run on a model very similar to Mexico's political parties, manipulating everything and everyone to achieve their goals. El Chapo is violent and ruthless, but so is almost everyone else in power, so there are really no \"good guys\" in the show, just different groups of people trying to advance their interests. It explains why the drug cartels came into existence in Mexico, why they got so out of hand, and why no one could stop them. With or without El Chapo, the drug trade continues today because it's not dependent on one man. It's a well-oiled machine that keeps running, and the leadership positions get filled by whoever is the most manipulative and ruthless, just like the political system. The most evil character in the show is Conrado Sol because he has no loyalty, no morals and no scruples, and yet he hypocritically pretends to be the savior of Mexico. As long as Mexico is in the hands of people like him, there's no solution to the problem of corruption and violence.<br/><br/>I appreciated that the show was from a Mexican point of view, and that the DEA characters had small roles. I'm not particularly interested in DEA agents, and am more interested in seeing how the drug trade impacts Mexican society. The violence engendered by the warring cartels and the Mexican government's war on drugs is of great importance to the Mexican people and has made life very difficult for them. While El Chapo is the recognizable name and face for the problem, the show made it clear that the problem is more widespread than that, and that the economic and social problems of Mexico created conditions in which drug trafficking became a viable way of making money. The show doesn't whitewash the violence of the narcos, but it does put it in a social context.<br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend the show to anyone who likes this genre. It's violent but not overly graphic. It's definitely binge worthy.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "24 out of 26 found this helpful.", "date": "12 December 2018"}, {"title": " Great series that will give you insight into Joaquin Guzman", "content": "What has struck me the most about this well-acted series is the sense of impending doom under which \"El Chapo\" lived. He worked hard and ruthlessly as a prolific murderer to become a \"Patron\" only to find his position always at the edge of a precipice. He is constantly betrayed, undermined, falsely accused (of the Cardinal's murder)and pursued by assassins. His life would make one wonder why anybody would be stupid enough to want his job. There would be a ton of cash but no peace ever in site for such a man or his family. I know of his impoverished upbringing. And that growing and trafficking drugs was the only way to make money in his isolated community. Multiple generations of his family were in the trade as Marijuana and Opium growers. His cousins were in it. He was born into it. But you would think that there would enough examples of how this would not end well for an intelligent man to make the decision to get out. Apparently in El Chapo's position it doesn't matter how smart one is. And you wonder if the lucky ones are not the ones who get killed early in their careers. Instead of living life constantly on the run from everyone and under daily mental suffering. This is a tale of some one willingly allowing himself to be sucked into an abyss. He had to know that if they didn't take his life, they would still take everything else. And they did. What you might question is the mentality of some one who continues going down that road despite knowing what lies at the end. And I also must question the mentality of a popular sub-culture in Mexico that worships and admires these \"Narcos.\" They write songs about them.

It's more like a political thriller and the government corruption at all the levels.

Here there's no glamourizing like Narcos. No fancy farms or lame parties. Here cartels are depicted as true criminals with no regard to anyone but them.

El Chapo is ambitious, but it's imperfections become obvious very soon. Whether you'll like this one will depend of course on your expectations, and this series has things to offer and also a few things that are lacking. <br/><br/>What El Chapo offers is a compelling - and ongoing - story about one of the most wealthy drug lords in the world. The story is told with eye to detail, and sheds a light on all facets of the enormous drug problem that cripples Mexican society. Its tone is grim, a bit flat, which is somewhat fitting to this particular story. <br/><br/>But what El Chapo is missing so profoundly is a heart. Nowhere in the series are there any true compelling and sympathetic characters. Whilst watching Narcos, I had that odd feeling of rooting for Escobar, even though I knew what he was. But never ever did I really root for El Chapo. I am in the middle of season 3 now and honestly, I just want to see him get killed. To me he's just uneducated, uncharismatic, callous and empty. But the 'good guys' aren't really nice either. Even the DEA is portrayed as an organisation that's after their cut of the business more than they are about fighting crime. And I know this is probably very close to the truth - but a series or movie simply needs at least one relatable character. <br/><br/>In a country where good and bad are often indistinguishable from each other, it seems only fair to paint the picture as such. Yet while El Chapo shouldn't try to be another Narcos, it should have taken more notes. <br/><br/>If you just like to be amused by a good, watchable story about true crime, I'd say give it a try.

Its only redeeming points are that within the constrains of very possible defamation and libel suits, it makes a fair attempt at showing the relationship between the governments (Mexican as well as USA) with the drug cartels; one star for that. Some of the casting efforts, even if the actors are at high school theater level, are uncanny (eg. the presidents and the cartel bosses) and the naming of the characters, albeit quite funny, allows the viewer to easily ID the real persons in the story; another star for that.<br/><br/>On the \"El Cheapo\" side, it was filmed in Colombia, in an attempt to avoid reprisals during filming. Thus the props, for somebody who knows how/where the narcos live, from houses, cars, jewelry, watches, lifestyle, etc. are -again- like something you would find in a high scool production; just doesn't match. As an indie effort it would pass. As a production of a solid American TV copany in partnership with Netflix is just plain unacceptable. There are goofs everywhere, from cars and trucks that belong in the 50's to houses that are visibly from another country, however I'm probably nitpicking. Nevertheless, with el Chapo in a NY jail and the rest of the players dead or in prison, they might easily have filmed in the true locations.<br/><br/>The whole series left me with the impression that the producers and the director are presenting Guzm\u00e1n in a glossy light, making him (and others) appear, times over, as victims of circumstances and government corruption, which while it's undeniable, also the criminals don't have an ounce of good in them: they are blood lusting murderers that don't hesitate to promote the corruption of the whole social fabric, starting from elementary school kids. Their families gloat in unlimited millions until they are busted, only to cry foul when the authorities and politicos take all.<br/><br/>In any case, the greatest sin is that the story is left unfinished as the second season ends six years ago 2012, leaving out a substantial part of the true story that is already written. The producers might be planning for a third season to give it closure; there's much to tell from then on, including the second capture, 2nd imprisonment in the Almoloya prison, last escape and final manhunt &amp; capture, as well as the extradition to the US that Guzm\u00e1n tried to avoid at all costs.

Some series make such a brief appearance on the television schedule that they are virtually totally forgotten. It would seem that even a seemingly good premise, proper casting and high volume publicity blitzing of promo spots cannot guarantee any degree of success at all. There are certain intangibles, like chemistry and good old luck, which play a big role in the ratings ordeal.<br/><br/>It does seem that a lot of our more successful situation comedies of recent years have had one thing in common. Where the main character so often would be someone who was above it all, we have finally begun to see the lead character's having a foible or two.<br/><br/>Hence we have been treated to an array of less than perfect main characters such as Judd Hirsch's Alex Reiger in \"TAXI\" (1978-83) or Ted Danson as Sam Malone in \"CHEERS\" (1982-93). These characters have all of the faults and foibles as any of us, and maybe even a tad more in some areas.<br/><br/>Then why not have a series about the comical trials and tribulations of a guy who just happens to be a Head Coach at a Major (though fictional) University having a big time Varsity Football Program. His life goes on all year long; he doesn't get put on a shelf after the Autumn Football Season. Even if their squad is playing in one of those big time Bowl Games around New Years Day, they still have things to do in February, March, April, etc.<br/><br/>That brings us to \"COACH\", and none too soon! The series is as much a success due to those in the cast, but they also had some very good comic situations in which to let their characters just do their thing.<br/><br/>The main characters are Head Coach Hayden Fox (Craig T. Nelson), his Fianc\u00e9e, Christine Armstrong, Asst. Coach, Luther Van Dam (Jerry Van Dyke) and Asst. Coach Dauber Dynzinski (Bill Fagerbake).<br/><br/>Most all of the series' episodes were built around these 4 adult characters and their problems with acceptance, status in the community and their relations with the opposite s-e-x. After all, just because one has been a Varsity Jock and B.M.O.C. doesn't mean that he wouldn't have a problem with acne or with finding the right girl as his mate.<br/><br/>Additionally, the series made good use of semi-regular and recurring characters. There's Hayden's Daughter from previous marriage, Kelly Fox (Clare Casey) and her totally non-athlete Boy Friend, Stuart Rosebrock (Kris Kam), who is a Theatre Major and a Mime. Athletic Director Howard Burleigh (Kenneth Kimmons) and wife Shirley (Georgia Engel) are always around as the \"Per-Fect\" couple. Howard's biggest foible his being the guy forever seeking proper respect as his position of Athletic Director.<br/><br/>And speaking of seeking recognition and respect, there are some problems wit the University's Band Director, Riley Pringel (Ray Birk). In one of our favourite episodes, Pringel attempts to have Luther's Basset Hound declared as an incurably viscous and dangerous to the community; because of a problem that occurred over mistaking a band leaders baton for hot dog. (Just see it!) <br/><br/>As for Luther, Jerry Van Dyke gets our award for hid \"dark horse\", \"sleeper\" of a character, who steals the show. In all of his years in Comedy and having Comic Roles in Films and TV, this is him at his very best.* He plays the 'Old Dumb Guy' to Bill Fagerbake's Dauber, a 'Young' Dumb Guy, but both characters are enjoyable, even lovable.<br/><br/>The setting of the mythical Minnesota State University served the series, its story lines and the cast quite well. There were plenty of \"situations\" developing that related to the team and its players; members of the \"Screaming Eagles\".<br/><br/>So then why did the Producers decide along about the 1995-96 season, in the series penultimate year on NBC, to change the locale? They went from coaching the fictitious Minnesota State University \"Screaming Eagles\" to the make believe Orlando Breakers of the National Football League. The routines were modified to fit into a situation that was in the NFL in sunny Florida, rather than North Woodsy Minnesota and the NCAA.<br/><br/>Perhaps the ratings on \"COACH\" were beginning to slip a little or something like that. Producer then decides to give it a little boost or bump in the Nielsens by a little transformation of setting. But obviously it didn't work.<br/><br/>It seems it never does. We remember similar situations with similar remedies in previous decades in such renowned situation comedy series. \"OUR MISS BROOKS\" (1952-56), McHALE's NAVY (1962-66) and \"LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY\" (1976-83) are all top rated sitcoms that followed the very same late series course correction in change of locale. In all cases, including that of \"COACH\", the change is done for the same reason, to give a renewed interest in its viewers. It's a sink or swim proposition.<br/><br/>In any case, no matter how popular and successful a series might be, it will still run its course, eventually running out of gas and passing on. Just like all of us.<br/><br/>NOTE: * Jerry Van Dyke said in an interview that in his time in show business he had once turned down the lead character of Gilligan in \"GILLIGAN'S ISLAND\"(1964-67) to accept the lead in \"MY MOTHER THE CAR\"(1965-66).

The best part about the show was that he was taking a team of nobodies and trying to turn a football program around at a fictitious school that supposedly had a once great football program.  Minnesota State was the underdog.  They started out taking things slow.  They didn't rush into making them champions.  In th first season they were happy to just get a few wins.

Sure, the team trying to defend their championship was enough to sustain one season.  But that was it.

The world simply is not so full of classics as we would like to believe. In the realm of TV sitcoms, there have probably been only a dozen or two truly classic series in the history of the medium. 'Coach' is definitely not among those hallowed numbers. It is, however, a good journeyman effort. While never hitting the heights of delirious inventiveness and wit of a classic sitcom, it also remained consistently good throughout its run, a feat that most classic sitcoms could never manage. It is a good, strong peasant of a show, not a blueblood or purebred show. I think that the contribution of Bill Fagerbakke should not be overlooked. In a series that usually spotlighted Craig Nelson and Jerry Van Dyke, Mr. Fagerbakke played a wonderful 'third banana' in Dauber. He was often the moral center of the show, grounding the other characters and still providing more than enough comedic moments. Fagerbakke gave a sensitivity and sweetness to the big dumb guy that made the character somehow more special than those of the two stars.

Luther's character went from a bumbling Three Stooges type of caricature to a mean spirited, spoiled, self-centered character who was no longer funny or endearing. By season 8 the Luther was so spiteful and mean that I actually hated his character and that continued until the end of the show. <br/><br/>Season 8 was a big mistake and the end of the show - even though it went another year - this was the beginning of the end. The entire NFL run made a mockery of the show that everyone had known and loved - it was so bad that ratings went down and it caused a beloved show to be cancelled. Nothing was good about seasons 8 and 9 - it made a fool out of Coach Fox, it continued the nastiness of Luther Van Damme and introduced the two worse characters in the entire 9 year run: Doris and Martine. Even getting rid of the ridiculous houseman Martine was too late to save the show.

The whole time they shot Coach in Minnesota, at least we saw for the first 4 seasons of Coach, we saw Hayden's daughter Kelly Fox (Played by \"Point Pleasant's\" Clare Carey), her boyfriend Stuart and also we saw Judy on the show. When Kelly came back in 1994, she smooched with Dauber (don't really know why), but at least it showed a lot of interest for the show. The big change was in the 1995-96 season when after 7 seasons at University of Minnesota, Hayden gets a job offer to head coach of the Orlando Breakers. In the last 2 seasons of the show, Hayden took the reigns as head Coach of the Orlando Breakers and moved out of the cabin that we saw for the 7 seasons of Coach, when they were at Orlando, the new head owner of the Breakers, Doris Sherman (Katherine Helmond) was cast and the Burleigh's Howard and Shirley were also bounded for Orlando. But for the last 2 seasons ABC slotted Coach on Saturday Nights, which is really great since I can watch it but because during the 1995-96 season ABC had one bug popular show called Drew Carey and that was why Coach dwindled after 200 episodes and 9 seasons. But the big ending to Coach was the 3 part finale \"Leaving Orlando\" In which the Foxes, the Burleighs, Dauber and Luther decided to retire back in Minnesota. Coach was a great show all throughout so my rating of Coach is<br/><br/>10/10! Great Coach game plan that goes in and out! Coach rules and is still one of my favorite shows on TV!

The supporting players were outstanding as well and they were easily recognized from the books.

She bed-hops in both books. In one, she visits a \"Witch,\" and gets a love potion. She slips it twice in the drink of a Police Inspector!, never thinking or caring if this could harm him. She pops into bed with him and she gets engaged to this decent man, not because she cares about him but to spite James Lacey. Within a few days she meets up with Sir Charles and sex with him....with her fianc\u00e9e finding them in bed. The second book was violent with three gruesome shotgun murders and two others. In both books Agatha is rescued multiple times by the police but continues to place herself and others in danger. She never thanks them or gives them credit for rescues. There is no way these books could be converted to a TV series for family viewing. <br/><br/>SERIES: I've seen the entire first season of Agatha and just recently bought the DVD set, I like it so much. This Agatha is funny, sometimes edgy, flirty, smart, makes friends and cares so much when one woman is killed she cries. She makes mistakes in the beginning, accusing some of the murder (and two are arrested just on her accusations!!). Eventually she uses her brain to consider the evidence before narrowing it down to the murderer. I love her friend played by Katy Wix and her daughter. Of course there were changes from the books but I can't complain. The series is entertaining and different from anything we get in the U.S. in terms of modern crime fighting.

So she buys a quiche, and things go downhill very quickly.

Of particular note is the acting of Allison Scott, the acting of Skeet Ulrich, and the understated but grounding performances of both McRaney and as his wife and the matriarch, the always fine Pamela Reed. It will be interesting to see if this strong start can be sustained, or if the storyline will wear thin. The executive production team is youthful but in combination has significant experience in film and in relationship-based TV that bodes well. In order for Jericho to survive, and it should, the tension needs to be maintained for the central family, for Jericho's attempts to survive, for the people of Jericho to maintain their humanity and their optimism, and for the outside world to impinge in a way that makes the struggle for the better parts of our human condition endure.

Others have written about the show's premise and storyline, so I won't repeat those here. As for my take on the show: First I have to say, anyone claiming that the acting is poor either stopped watching after a couple episodes or watched a different show entirely. Rarely have I seen such moving performances on television or anywhere else. I found myself relating to almost all the characters, and their hardships were believable and realistic. If anything, the acting was TOO moving; my wife and I were both teared up a few times, and given that several of the main characters die and there is no shortage of sad moments.<br/><br/>The other thing Jericho has no shortage of is red herrings. Just when you think you've an angle figured out, there comes a twist. But the twists make sense and keep you interested.<br/><br/>**spoilers** Behind the story of the characters is the hostile takeover of the USA by subversive forces within the US government itself. What appeals to me here is that the writers address the biggest problem our real life US government faces - severe corruption and the supremacy of corporate influence over our political system. The terrorists in Jericho are not religious zealots or militant patriots. They are very high ranking government officials working along with corporate interests to use a false flag operation (the nuke attacks) to take over the USA and replace the current government with a new one. The new one, in this case, is a federal government that delegates its day to day power to two corporations - Jennings &amp; Rall (aka Haliburton) and Ravenwood (aka Blackwater). Of any threat to our democracy, corporate and banking influence are the most dangerous because they are the most powerful. Jericho presents us with a nightmare vision of what life would be like under the boot of such powers. The Bill of Rights is just a memory. No right to due process or fair trial; if you don't do what you're told you are a \"security risk\" and you disappear. Your property is subject to seizure without notice, warrant, or compensation. All of you personal information is recorded and put in a database. You have no privacy. Jennings &amp; Rall control all commerce and bleed the people dry with price gouging while using Ravenwood to violently suppress any free market or black market competition, even while people suffer from want.<br/><br/>This really would be life under such corporations, and this is what Jericho shows us. And that, in turn, is what makes it so scary. Because if you stop to think about who the real threat in America is, it's not a handful of Saudis with box cutters on planes, or some poor deluded schmuck that the FBI can string along and then arrest for show. The real threat comes from capitalism overtaking democracy instead of complimenting it. It's a threat that is all too real, and Jericho warns us against allowing such a future to come to pass. That message, along with simply being a very well written and entertaining show, is what makes Jericho one of the great TV series of my time. Sadly, the shows ratings didn't live up to its writing and it was canceled way too soon. Evidently people would rather watch the likes of Snookie drunkenly prancing around making an immature ass of herself over trivial problems than come to grips with a potential future we may someday face in one form or another.

Where is the big employer, like a shoe factory or a plastic-extruding plant? You can't tell me the town is one to two thousand farmers and their families. <br/><br/>Farmers would be too busy and too far away to hang out in a bar all day, they'd have supplies of gasoline and food at their farms, plus old agricultural machinery and other equipment that doesn't require gasoline and there would be people who would have the knowledge to operate it. <br/><br/>A town of five thousand would have a courthouse, a bank, and leading citizens. There would be power dynamics and struggles that were in place before the catastrophe. <br/><br/>In the most recent episode we learn that the Greens have a ranch out in the countryside with a barn full of horses. A barn full of horses is a time-consuming high-maintenance endeavor, not some place you visit in the fourth episode because you need to get Jake Green worked up. <br/><br/>We also learn that the people of Jericho turn to the mayor and police when their utilities stop working. There does not appear to be an electric substation anywhere near the town nor anyone in the town who appears to know where the electricity came from. <br/><br/>It looks like the creators of this show got their concept for a small town from their experience with suburban bedroom communities.

I read the book, watched the film and did that over 40 years ago. Enough has been said about both in prior reviews that it just doesn't seem necessary for me to go over ground that's already been covered be it good or be it bad. So I'll start as I mean to go on and address THIS story in THIS TIME.<br/><br/>Good storytelling is a rare and beautiful thing. Using effects to define your characters instead of characters to be there while you show off the effects is becoming as rare as really good storytelling. So letting a plot play itself out in it's own time instead of at a breakneck pace designed to please horror/action fans who want action and gore to define a story instead of characters and the events that have shaped them is becoming equally rare. As the implosion of Penny Dreadful made many of us aware, good storytelling, incredible characters &amp; actors, beautiful sets and costumes, combined with action in service of the story still wasn't enough to save it from destruction. One that many of us are still hurting over.<br/><br/>So now we have Fox's The Exorcist... and after only one episode (which is all it took me for PD by the way) I know enough to be willing to commit myself to whatever amount of time has been given to this series in it's freshman season. Because, for me, the bottom line is that it's a really good example of good storytelling and it's nice to come back to worthy TV after running off to the solace of my bookshelves after the great debacle that was S/3 of PD.<br/><br/>I like the priests. I like that we're seeing signs that their backstories are going to be more fleshed out. I was appreciative of the nod made to the movie out of what was clearly respect and I especially like that the family involved is both diverse and will also have stories of their own to tell. So, in short, it already appears to me that The Exorcist plans to be an actual STORY; played out over a season and that it takes itself, it's characters and it's audience seriously.<br/><br/>Right now, that's more than enough for me. In point of fact, it's enough to guarantee that I'm going to be there throughout it's freshman season hoping against hope that it too has started as it means to go on.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "90 out of 107 found this helpful.", "date": "27 September 2016"}, {"title": " Superb Storytelling", "content": "The Exorcist is not a reboot of the original movie.

Alfonso Herrera grows into his role, just as his character, Fr Tom\u00e1s Ortega does in his. Season one has Academy Award winner Geena Davis and Alan Ruck. In addition is the truly great performance by young actress Hannah Kasulka and the strong supporting role in Brianne Howey. Each episode slowly reveals the nature of the demonic possession. The demon is played with exquisite perfection by Robert Emmett Lunney. Kurt Egyiawan plays Fr Bennett who is protecting the exorcists from the Church officials. I don't want to say too much. Suffice it to say the entire cast of season one is perfect. The struggle is real.\n Season two jumps ahead 6 months with a slow build to reveal the evil. Soon situations come to fruition and Marcus and Ortega find themselves helping a social worker and a foster dad, played beautifully by Li Jun Li and the greatest performance to date by John Cho. Every child actor in this story is perfectly cast. It's as if they're a real foster family. The cinematography in this season and the special effects are remarkable and surprisingly stunning for network television. The music score is perfect. This season surpasses, if possible, season one. The story takes time to build as the expert writers help give great character development, something not often found in horror. There are no cheap jump scares. It's a slow build to perfection.\n The Exorcist was canceled by Fox and I think they simply couldn't handle the superb show. It's too good for network television. Hopefully one of the streaming services will pick it up. It is definitely bingeworthy and you're left wanting more, much more. Every aspect of The Exorcist is film worthy.

Similarly, I also liked The Conjuring 1 and 2, Insidious 1 and 2, The Ring, The Babadook, and The Thing (1982). Talking about TV shows that are usually categorized as horror, I also enjoy The Walking Dead. American Horror Story is meh-ish but Season 1-2 were pretty good. Lastly, Supernatural isn't exactly horror nowadays, but I still enjoy watching it.<br/><br/>I think it's important that you know about my taste in horror, so you can judge and weigh my review. I started watching this episode with a skeptical mind, knowing how this reboot of a TV series of my favorite horror movie could go horribly wrong, likely many other remakes and reboots out there.<br/><br/>So, the episode started off as you might have expected, hints of horror and tension, but nothing really to make you jump out of your seat. However, after around 10-15 minutes, it started to become really interesting. There were scenes of genuine suspense, and no, I'm not talking about strange noises (which are pretty standard in all horror movies), but actually a few attempts at exorcism.<br/><br/>This is where the show really started to shine for me, the special effects used were decent, though I would appreciate a little less close-ups to the face and shaking cameras in future episodes. But generally, it was overall pretty good and reminded me a lot of the movie and the book (yes, I've read it) it's based on. I also liked the references sneaked in (especially the one in the article, and right at the end).<br/><br/>Acting was spot-on. I have seen Ben Daniels in House of Cards, and Geena Davis in Stuart Little, but the rest of the cast were generally unknown to me. That said, all of them really surprised me with excellent acting, especially Alfonso Herrera, Hannah Kasulka, and Brianne Howie. These characters actually felt relate-able and not the usual nincompoops we see in horror movies. I liked how the characters immediately consulted specialists instead of dragging the thing out for two or three episodes.<br/><br/>As this is a spoiler-free review, I'm not going to go into the details, but if I had to rate the following out of 10, this is how I would do it:<br/><br/>Story: 9 ||||| Cast / Acting: 9.5 ||||| Dialog: 8.5 ||||| Horror: 8.5 ||||| Direction / Effects etc: 8.5 ||||| Originality: 9.5<br/><br/>The only thing I found slightly lacking was the amount of horror in it. Sure, there were legit scenes of terror, but I'd really like to see the show go beyond and scare the hell out of me like The Exorcist did. (I couldn't sleep the entire night after I watched that movie almost four years ago, when I was 16).<br/><br/>All in all, if you're bored of the current \"horror\" shows which are kind of failing at horror *cough* AHS *cough* Supernatural *cough*, this is looking like the show to go to. That said, this is just my reaction after watching one episode, and I could be wrong.

A Must watch!<br/><br/>Episode 1: Having seen almost all the 'Exorcist' series including the Chris MacNeil case, I would say this one has done an amazing job for a good T.V. 'The Exorcist' has been the scariest movie ever made and the producer Jeremy Slater decided to be brave and created a new T.V version of it paying homage to the original without stealing the entire story line, however kept affiliations with the same (I am a big fan of 'Tubular Bells' theme from the original).<br/><br/>This case is of the Rance family, though I am not sure if series is going to get beyond a single case. Angela Rance (Geena Davis, YES!) is a devout Catholic who turns to her parish sympathetic priest, Father Tomas Ortega (played by Alfonso Herrera), when her house seems spooked. Tomas had doubts about his faith and having believed for so long that demons are not real, starts his research by simply doing a Google search on exorcism. He finds a newspaper article alluding to the deaths (as portrayed in the 1973 movie) of Fathers Merrin (Max von Sydow) and Karras (Jason Miller) in the Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) case. Hence, this T.V version can be considered as a prequel. He also discovers a link to an exorcism performed in Mexico City by Father Marcus Keane (Ben Daniels), an apostate living nearby in the St. Aquinas Retreat Centre. He takes interest in finding more about Father Marcus as he has seen him in his visions/dreams performing exorcism on Gabriel, a boy who was possessed. (scenes from his dreams were really chilling and spooky!)<br/><br/>There were few things that did not go well. The connection between Father Marcus and Tomas is yet to be understood (may be they have a purpose, together as a means of help to the Rance family?). <br/><br/>Horror movie scripts take a lot of time to build the case with characters getting involved in some sort of demonic happenings that makes them believe that their house/family is haunted. Here, however, the story went two-three gear ahead with characters self-concluding the demonic presence in their house. That was quick. (UPDATE, after watching episode 5, this is now justified)<br/><br/>There are scenes that are scary, the story line from the very first episode gives you a surprise element. The ending was spot on, leading viewers to get hooked for upcoming episodes. Overall, this is a must watch. Do not get disappointed if you feel the pace was kinda-slow in the beginning as this is pilot (first episode) and hopefully the makers are trying to build the case before we actually see what is this all about.

The original cast included Dixie Carter, Delta Burke, Annie Potts, Jean Smart, and Meshach Taylor. The humor was outrageously funny, witty and topical and the actors all worked well as an ensemble since their characters were so well-defined and very different. I am puzzled by the many negative comments about this show stating that it was not funny. Were these people watching the same show that I was?<br/><br/>In 1991, both Delta Burke and Jean Smart left the series and were replaced by Julia Duffy, who had played Stephanie on \"Newhart,\" and Jan Hooks, an alumna of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Both were fine actresses but their characters were not well fleshed-out. Duffy's Allison Sugarbaker was a New Yorker and, in my opinion, just never caught on with viewers. Hooks' Carlene Dobber was simply a nitwit, which is a shame because Jan Hooks was hysterical and very versatile on all the seasons she was on SNL. They never developed a multi-layered character that utilized her full comedic potential, but rather one that was mostly a one-note caricature. So, this truly fine and funny actress was wasted in a silly role. Julia Duffy was replaced the next and final season by Judith Ivey, whose character was again a Southern type who fit seamlessly into the ensemble.<br/><br/>I often think the best character was Bernice Clifton as played by the outrageously funny and talented Alice Ghostley. Next to Suzanne Sugarbaker, this character had some hilarious and unforgettable lines.<br/><br/>There are many terrific episodes of this series.

In my opinion this was the best episode of the entire series. The writers and actors were at their peak of hilarity when they produced this little gem back in 1990. I've seen it many times and it never fails to make me laugh out loud. This particular episode had all the elements that made Designing Women one of the best television sitcoms in history. Dim-witted Charlene Stillfield makes a home video to send back to her hillbilly clan in Poplar Bluff. Aging beauty queen Suzanne Sugarbaker at her most 'PMS-on-a-diet' bitchy, shrieks \"Happy Anniversary, Lois and Shimmy!\" into Charlene's camcorder. Sassy single mother Mary Jo Shively is whining about some sexist pig again. Feminist Julia Sugarbaker is her usual cool-collected self but getting more frazzled by the minute. Ditzy senior-citizen Bernice Clifton drops by and so does Daddy Jones, an old mountain man. When Daddy breaks out the moonshine things really get zany. Ex-con Anthony Bouvier and his annoying girlfriend Vanessa groove to motown tunes in the background. It's an all-out madcap party. As Bernice and Daddy Jones dirty dance, Julia delivers the funniest line of the show, \"I don't ever wanna see anything like this in my home again.\" Then, a nerdy client drunk on moonshine, strips down to bikini briefs and proceeds to sexually harass all the women. Luckily, a tornado rips through Sugarbaker's before things get too out of hand. The next day as everyone cleans up the mess, Charlene's outrageous home video airs on CNN...the perfect ending to this perfect episode. Many thanks to Dixie Carter, Delta Burke, Jean Smart, Annie Potts, Meshach Taylor and Alice Ghostley for making us laugh for seven great seasons. Now we can see them all again everyday on Lifetime.

These wonderful actresses fleshed out their characters so were able to laugh, be appalled, and cry with them: Julia, the widow, outspoken with a good heart; Suzanne, her beauty queen sister, selfish, shallow, and lovable; Charlene, the patsy, pretty, sweet, and naive; Mary Jo, the divorc\u00e9e, struggling with dating and motherhood, self-deprecating and funny.

Designing Women has always been one of my all-time favorite sitcoms. For the record I am also a huge fan of The Golden Girls. As many know these two shows have been heavily compared and contrasted for the longest time. The two shows do have striking similarities and many out there have accused Designing Women of ripping The Golden Girls off (And I do believe there is a hint of truth to that, but we'll save that for another time) but Designing Women stands completely on it's own. In many ways I think there is a sense of humanism &amp; realism in Designing Women that is lacking in The Golden Girls, but enough about them.<br/><br/>I fell in love with the show straight from the Pilot. I was still in grade school but I thought it was hysterical. I enjoyed the great cast of characters and how beautifully they played off of one another. And the actresses who played those characters were amazing. Whether it was the kooky yet vulnerable Charlene (Jean Smart), the confidence and dry wit of Julia (Dixie Carter), the semi-neurotic girl next door Mary Jo (Annie Potts) or the over the top drama (And silliness) of Suzanne (Delta Burke), these characters made me laugh and laugh. They were all great performers but Delta Burke as Suzanne truly stood out as a one of a kind comedic talent. Burke surprised critics and viewers alike by showing she could bring a self absorbed former beauty queen (With a secret heart of gold) to new heights of hilarity. The show also benefited from the strong political sensibilities of it's creator/producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason as the show often took liberal political stances during a time when it was relatively taboo for sitcoms to do so. The show did struggle during it's last couple of seasons primarily due to a revolving door of cast changes. First, it was the very abrupt departure of Burke, which from a viewer stand-point was somewhat jarring. What I mean by that is that we had one of the strongest (And funniest) characters literally vanish in thin air without ANY explanation, it really kinda threw things off for awhile. After Burke departed we than saw Charlene leave. At least this time there was an explanation, her military husband had suddenly been permanently transferred to the UK. Next was the truly AWFUL casting of Julia Duffy as Sugarbaker cousin, Allison. Though I hold no ill-will towards the acting talent of Duffy, the character of Allison Sugarbaker was dreadful. She was completely unlikeable and had NO redeeming qualities. Someone must've thought the same thing as she too vanished without a trace after just 1 season. Let us also not forget the season 6 finale \"Shades of Vanessa\" which attempted to set up black comedienne Jackee' as a possible partner in the Sugarbaker firm for the upcoming 7th season. This idea never panned out, for whatever reason. Although it never \"Jumped The Shark\", the Allison character came pretty close to pushing it over that edge. I think Jan Hooks should get special mention as someone who continuously elevated the show. With a few years of Saturday Night Live experience under her belt she managed to create a funny, memorable character in that of Carlene Dawber, the sweet yet strange little sister of the departed Charlene. Eventually another character hopped on board, that of BJ (Played nicely by Judith Ivey) a wealthy widow who, in it's final season, became a partner to save the ailing Sugarbaker firm. I will always remember Designing Women as a genuinely funny show with quirky yet believable characters and great writing, despite some of it's messy cast changes. My all-time favorite episode is \"Pearls of Wisdom\", just for the laugh-til-you-cry hilarity of the salad bar scene.<br/><br/>At the time of this writing (June 07') a season-by-season DVD release is pending. Sony (The studio that will release DW on DVD) initially intended to release Season 1 in the summer of 06. However, a season-by-season release has been stalled due to music clearances. This is completely plausible considering the dozens (and dozens) of songs/pieces of music used throughout the series. Sony has stated that due to a market saturation of TV to DVD releases, the music industry is taking advantage of this by demanding big bucks for music licensing. Sony says that the music fees are so high that if they were to go ahead with the shows release it would mean a much higher than usual retail price for the sets. Sony has repeated that they are committed to releasing the show on DVD but want to keep the price point low so that casual fans and hardcore fans alike can enjoy the show without raping their wallets.

In its halcyon days, it was witty, irreverent, intelligent, and altogether a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The series revolved around four women who ran a design firm together in Atlanta, Georgia. Julia Sugarbaker (Dixie Carter) was an intelligent and outspoken woman, who ran the business out of her house. Her sister Suzanne (Delta Burke) was an oft married - and divorced - aging beauty queen, who, while also outspoken, lacked her sister's intelligence and sensitivity. Mary Jo Shively (Annie Potts) was a divorced mother of two, still trying to get her confidence back after the end of her marriage. Office manager Charlene Frazier (Jean Smart) was a country girl with a heart of gold, if not the most sense in the world. They were assisted by delivery man, and eventual partner, Anthony Bouvier (Meshach Taylor), the lone male and the lone black in the business, an ex-con who seemed surprisingly comfortable spending the bulk of his time with four white women. After Burke and Smart left the show in 1991, two new characters were introduced, Allison Sugarbaker (Julia Duffy, the kiss of death to every sitcom she's ever been in except for Newheart), an erstwhile cousin who was obnoxious, self absorbed, and completely unlikeable, and Carlene Dobber (Jan Hooks), Charlene's sister, who was nothing but a dim witted country bumpkin. Fortunately, Duffy left after a year, but by then it was too late to save the series, which limped along to its close with Judith Ivey playing a new partner, the rich, widowed B. J. Poteet.<br/><br/>Guest stars were frequent, and several played characters which recurred with great frequency. Hal Holbrook (Carter's real life husband) played Reese Watson, Julia's love interest for the first several seasons until he left to do Evening Shade. Gerald McRaney (who eventually became Burke's real life husband) played one of Suzanne's ex-husbands. Richard Gilliland (who married Jean Smart after meeting her on the set - see the pattern here) played Mary Jo's boyfriend for the first few seasons. And the dashing Douglas Barr (who apparently was not involved with any other cast member) played Col. Bill Stillfield, the man Charlene eventually married. The favorite by far, however, was Alice Ghostley as Bernice Clifton, an eccentric with a joie de vivre which left the others stunned.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the series sparkled with wit and humor as it dealt with the lives of these four women, so different, and yet so similar. Julia's passion for life, justice, and feminism was revealed in fiery, but incredibly humorous long winded speeches. Suzanne's brash self-absorption contrasted well with her vulnerability and her loyalty to those she loved. Mary Jo's growing sense of self was handled quite well. And Charlene's hopeless romanticism culminated in her marriage and her gracefully rising to the challenges of being a military wife and a working mother. In its hay day, the series also took on some interesting issues - AIDS, sexuality, death and dying, menopause, among others. Unfortunately, after Burke and Smart left, the writing took a turn for the worse, losing its sparkle, and settling for silliness instead of wit.<br/><br/>Like many sit-coms of its era, this one stayed on the air a little too long, and I personally found the last two seasons very regrettable.

(spoilers)", "content": "The Golden Girls, NBC's great sitcom of four senior women sharing a house together in Miami may have paved the way for the success of Designing Women, which debuted the following year in 1986.<br/><br/>Like the Golden Girls, this was a show primarily about single (and eventually married) women who worked at Sugarbakers, an interior design firm in Atlanta, Georgia. Dixie Carter, my favorite, played sharp-tongued Julia Sugarbaker, a product of proper Southern upbringing but with a progressive and bold outlook. As the Golden Girls always took their opportunity for political commentary (often more liberal) on all sorts of issues (probably because it was easier to address these in a cast of all women versus one of all men), Julia Sugarbaker was often the primary character for political expression. Julia was a character never afraid to speak her mind, though sometimes, she did tend to come off as somewhat irritable than wise when the point was made too often. Though, they were important issues nonetheless. Like the Golden Girls, it was an opportune moment, hailing from the days of Regan and eventually Bush, Sr. With a cast of middle-aged Southern women and one black ex-convict (Anthony Bouvier played by Mesach Taylor, who became a cast regular shortly into the first season), these issues were obviously abundant: feminism, race, AIDs, religion, poverty, and so forth. This was the age of television, afterall, when show's creators were still allowed to openly speak their mind (for the most part anyway). <br/><br/>Annie Potts, my favorite comedienne, was Mary Jo Shively, equally cynical. Although, earlier versions of her character, before they worked out the kinks in the first season, came off as quite arrogant at times. Shively was the single woman, mother of two who often scoffed at their strange clientelle and also pursued political positions with Julia, though not as often. <br/><br/>Jean Smart was the flamboyant Charlene Frazier, a real goofy character with a pleasant personality who seemed to always have all the knowledge of trivial and tabloid information. <br/><br/>But, perhaps the biggest draw to the show was Delta Burke who plays snippy former-Miss Atlanta sister to Julia, Suzanne Sugarbaker. Once Mesach Taylor became a regular in the cast, his character Anthony was often forced into hilarious situations with Suzanne. Suzanne, who owned a pot bellied pig named Noel and was known for wielding a handgun and had a Phillipino maid named Conseulla who was rumored to have put curses on Suzanne. At the time, Delta Burke was married to Gerald MacReiny, former Major Dad star, who later plays her ex-husband, Graham on Designing Women. Dixie Carter, too, played alongside her husband, Hal Holbrook, who played her boyfriend, Reece.<br/><br/>Despite a great assortment of characters which appear slightly modeled by the Golden Girls cast, this show, unlike the Golden Girls, was not as successful from beginning to end. At the start of the first season, they had problems really finding a niche for each of their characters. At first, it was only the four women, but soon Anthony became a cast regular as the Sugarbaker handyman. And soon, even he developed a more dominant role, often in episodes dealing with his hilarious misadventures with Suzanne. Alice Ghostly, one of my favorites, was the next to join the show as the incredibly zany, but lovable Bernice Clifton. (I love the show where she hosts the public access show and tells everyone that the Sugarbaker interior design firm is just a front for a prostitution house, mortifying Julia and the rest who thought they were on the air to discuss designing).<br/><br/>And, despite an all-star cast by this point, each providing many great qualities and plenty of laughs, the show underwent a cast change, probably due to Delta Burke's on-going battle with depression. She was the first to leave and soon, so did Jean Smart who was written off the show when her character, Charlene, gets married and has a baby and soon, becomes a stay-at-home mom. These were two powerful players on the show, and Delta Burke certainly had the biggest draw, which was a powerful act to follow for Jan Hooks, Judith Ivey, and the arrogant Julia Duffy, none of whom (except maybe Hooks who is always good as the moron character like she played in 3rd Rock From the Son) could pull it off. They joined the show in 1991 and the show eventually ended in 1993. But perhaps this is not soley attributed to a cast change. Four years on the air (as of of 1991) is still a good run.

The Hulk represented a kind of \"Elephant Man\" character, who certainly looks scary, but is genuinely kind and gentle and wants to help people in trouble (sort of a one man A-Team). I don't remember him ever seriously hurting anyone, and most of the physical parts involved him bending gun barrels so they couldn't be fired or turning cars over on their roofs.

Bill Bixby, God rest his soul, was so terrific as Dr. David Banner I can't imagine another actor playing that part. Lou Ferrigno was almost the closest thing we would have to a real, breathing Hulk on this Earth. You'd think it was the real deal if you watched enough episodes of this classic. And Jack Colvin, another treasured loss to mourn since his passing in 2005, was so perfect in his role of hyperactive nosy tabloid reporter Jack McGee.

Another one was that Banner never got his cure that he so hungered for. He came close sometimes, but never did. And Hulk never did a chance to speak any during the show. It would've been so cool to hear the big green dude say a few words. Instead he would roar and often cry. What a shame. This show fares tons better than the 2003 Ang Lee movie, which would have been better probably if Bill Bixby had not died and maybe did a nice cameo. It did have a short scene with Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee as security guards which was okay, but too darn short. I think that the show also fared better than the three reunion movies that later aired on NBC in 1988, 1989, and 1990.

You would too if your body grew to three times its normal size and yet your trousers stayed the same.\". Everyone from Ken Dodd to Eddie Large used it in their act at one time or other. I only mention it because it gives you an idea how popular this series was in the late '70's/early '80's. <br/><br/>Loosely based on the Marvel comic book of the same name, 'T.I.H.' told the story of Dr.David Banner ( Bill Bixby ), a brilliant scientist who got an accidental overdose of gamma radiation during an experiment, and then when stressed out turned into the Hulk - a grotesque, powerful monster with skin the colour of vomit and a tendency towards mindless destruction. This being a family show, of course, he wasn't too violent, and dealt with the bad guys usually by picking them up and hurling them into rivers. He also got through a lot of shirts during the course of the series.<br/><br/>Banner was thought to have perished when his lab blew up, but a nosey reporter by the name of 'McGee' ( Jack Colvin ) was keen to get at the truth and so dogged him every step of the way, a sort of 'Lieutenant Gerard' to Banner's 'Richard Kimble'.<br/><br/>Each week, Banner turned up in a different location, got a job ( altering his surname so that it still began with 'B' ), became involved with a local problem, which he then solved by 'Hulking out'. Perhaps the show should have been retitled 'The Incredible Social Worker'.<br/><br/>The Hulk, as a rule, only made two appearances per episode, with Bixby's 'Banner' carrying the show. The actor was familiar to viewers thanks to 'My Favourite Martian' and 'The Magician'. I always felt that he was an underrated performer who sadly never got the parts he deserved. I'm sure he could not have been too pleased when the script for the 'Hulk' pilot landed on his doormat, but to his credit, he brought a quiet dignity to the role, much as Richard Basehart did with 'Admiral Nelson' in 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea'. Jack Colvin ( another underrated actor ) was equally excellent as 'McGee'. One of the best episodes - 'Proof Positive' - had McGee ( Banner did not appear that week ) explaining his motivations for hunting the creature. Muscle-man Lou Ferrigno proved the perfect embodiment of the Hulk. Much better than any C.G.I. rubbish. <br/><br/>Critics in the U.K. reacted with disbelief when 'T.I.H.' first appeared. Margaret Forwood of 'The Sun' said that it was 'even sillier than the Man From Atlantis', while another likened the Hulk to the 'Jolly Green Giant'. <br/><br/>The public ignored the complaints and made the show a hit that ran for five years. I personally found it a refreshing change of pace after the high campery of superhero shows such as 'Batman' and 'Wonder Woman'.<br/><br/>A trio of Hulk T.V. movies cropped up at the end of the '80's, but they were not much good. The first two featured ludicrous versions of two other Marvel characters - 'The Mighty Thor' and 'Daredevil'. <br/><br/>More recently, we have had Ang Lee's 'Hulk' ( 2003 ) and now a new one starring Edward Norton.

What could have been laughable television show about a giant green monster strutting around smashing things, instantly became a classic hit when it was deemed a serious and realistic drama for the time.<br/><br/>The show follows the compassionate and likable character Dr. David Banner who had been attempting to discover the secrets of human strength after his wife died in a car explosion. Banner is obsessed with finding these answers of hidden strength and ultimately renders himself to unpredictable experiment. He exposes himself to gamma radiation which unfortunately results in a horrifying metamorphosis. Whenever Banner becomes angry or outraged he transforms into massive green monster which we all know and love as the incredible hulk.<br/><br/>After the hulk is discovered and pursued by an investigative reporter named Jack McGee, Banner goes on the run hoping to stay hidden until he can find a way to cure himself from his dreadful manifestation I first discovered \"The Incredible Hulk\" In my teens when I was greatly entertained by comic books. When I first viewed the show I realized that it was different but different in a good way. Yes, the scenes with the hulk are slightly outdated but the story is where you really get involved. The show only features the hulk for about fifteen minutes at most sometimes even less.<br/><br/>People I'm acquainted with often complain that the hulk itself does not gain enough screen time. Simply this is because this show is not entirely about the hulk. Its a serious and persuasive drama that tells the story of man who has a condition that he desperately wants to rid himself of. The show may not be entirely faithful to its comic book counterpart but I believe the decision to alter the story line was well apprehended.<br/><br/>The hulk in this setting is more realistic and strays away from the comic book cheesiness. I honestly have to admit that this is one of the best live action comic adaptations to date. This show is well remembered and was apart of many people's childhoods.

The series was the same.<br/><br/>The Hulk was a good family show. The late Bill Bixby did a wonderful job as Dr. Banner. Throughout the entire series I felt myself feeling really sorry for Banner like he was a close friend. Banner was a character who the audience could empathize with. He was a good man who travelled across the United States trying to avoid conflict for he knew that when he became the Hulk he was uncontrollable. He was pursued by ambitious reporter Jack McGee who wanted to capture the Hulk in order to become a star reporter.<br/><br/>Throughout the series Banner would encounter various characters who were having trouble in their lives. He would do his best to help but it would always fall to the Hulk to save the day. In a way I think this series was telling us that reason and diplomacy will only take us so far and that in the end it's down to strength to save the day. <br/><br/>Lou Ferrigno did a good job as the Hulk. There was an important lesson in this series;never judge anyone by what they look like. The Hulk was a good guy who always saved the day but as far as the likes of McGee were concerned the Hulk was a bad guy. In fact, McGee believed that the Hulk had killed Elaina Marks and David Banner in the original movie. So Banner did his best to avoid McGee for confrontation with him would reveal his secret.<br/><br/>The Hulk was in fact a good role model. He had the strength to do real damage to anyone or anything but he never killed throughout the series. On occasion he even saved the lives of bad guys who were trying to kill him. But still he was judged as a monster to be destroyed.<br/><br/>Philosophical thinking aside, the Hulk was a great action show. The Hulk did some amazing things throughout such as surviving a fall from a plane or tangling with a huge grizzly bear. He could not be hurt apart from the odd bullet he took.<br/><br/>The entire series was great.

The Six Million Dollar Man started it, and The Incredible Hulk copied it, having the Hulk do everything in slow motion.

Another is Never Give A Trucker An Even Break which uses a LOT of stock footage from the Steven Spielberg Duel movie, also we have...well...pretty much all of the 1st season is a highlight as its all still new and fresh.<br/><br/>Season 2 starts with Married a 2 parter and earned Mariette Hartley an Emmy as Best Actress in a Drama series. Another 2 parter i have to mention is Mystery Man part 1 and 2 where David Banner and the ever present Reporter Jack McGee spend most of the time together but with Davids face covered in bandages Jack never gets to see him in this one. The Hulk does save Jack in this one and i think it may be the start of the turning point for Jack starting to believe.....just a little...that this green monster isn't so much of a monster after all like he 1st thought. Kindred Spirit is another one worth mentioning where David joins an expedition that found evidence that there may have been another Hulk many many years ago.<br/><br/>The 3rd season doesn't have the cracking start like the 1st 2 had, i think Mystery Man would have been a good one to start season 3 but again we are treated to the mini mysteries with lots of scenes of David always loosing a a fight and then lots of shirt ripping and The Hulk taking care of business just how we love it to be. In this season we have David loose his sight in Blind Rage, we see David be a Magician's assistant in My Favourite Magician and mention that he knows nothing about being a magician (Little amusing as he place a Magician in another good and successful series), we get to meet David's Sister and Father all of which makes season 3 also a must see.<br/><br/>WOW season 4 starts with a cracking opener Prometheus a 2 parter that is more like a movie than a TV series. Here we get to see David stuck half way between David and The Hulk, then getting captured and then...oh you will have to watch to find out. We get the gangster style episode Goodbye Eddie Cain directed by Jack Colvin.The episode we thought we would never see, King Of The Beach where top billing goes to Lou Ferrigno, not just as the hulk but as Lou with a speaking role and doing what he does best, working out. What a treat we get, we get Lou AND The Hulk in the same shot...brilliant...and they still managed to make it look like The Hulk is much taller than Lou.<br/><br/>Still with season 4 we are again given a great 2 parter called The First where we get to see another Hulk and the 2 Hulks go head to head. I have to say the other Hulk is awful and way too camp but very tall...i won't give any more away than that...but this would have been entertaining enough to be a good season opener. This is followed by The Harder They Fall where we see David paralyzed, so what will happened with him in this state and he turns into The Hulk?? watch it and see. Then we have Interview With The Hulk where Emerson Fletcher, a colleague of Jack McGee at the National Register manage to get a lead on The Hulk and convinced David to do an interview which he captures on tape. Now i thought these tapes may surface again in a later episode but we don't know what ever happened to them other than Emerson had them again. A future story could have been made from this one. The rest of the season is OK and nothing special...maybe because we had been spoiled so much with earlier episodes in this season but still remains the best season.<br/><br/>Season 5 starts as OK like season 4 ended which led me to believe that these episodes were just left over from season 4 and i read somewhere that they were apart from the final 2. This season's last 2 episodes Slaves and A Minor Problem felt like they may have been the real season 5 episodes. A Minor Problem was the final episode of The Incredible Hulk, it was a good one but certainly not a series ender. I understand that everyone was keen to carry on with the series but no one really said why it ended, maybe it was costing too much?<br/><br/>It's Sad that both Bill and Jack are no longer with us. There was talk of other episodes that had been thought about, i think Bill or Lou may have mentioned one about The Hulk talking and director Kenneth Johnson had an idea about bringing David's Sister back into it and needing a blood transfusion from David.

Dr. Banner travels cross country hoping to some day finding a cure for his condition but along the way he gets into all sorts of trouble that forces the Hulk to surface and square matters. Every episode ends with David leaving before relentless reporter Jack McGee tracks him down.<br/><br/>The shows are made with passion, that's evident. Good quality writing for the most part, well done action sequences (compared to a 70's TV show anyway), compelling story lines in most episodes, nice location crew work and fantastic actors. As said, the premise is fairly simple as David transforms about 20-25 min. into each episode and during the climax. Also, he somehow manages to get into a whole lot of trouble by just being at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>The first season shows are not all great and do showcase the limitations budget wise. The episode \"Never give a trucker an even break\" shamelessly borrows footage from Steven Spielberg's Duel, even the classic ending is fitted into the storyline. \"Earhquakes happen\" borrows quite a lot from Earthquake, the 70's disaster flick, but that's not as blatant as the previous example. Also there is a lot of stock footage used every now and then. Sometimes it's little snippets of Hulk action and sometimes it's David on the road hitchhiking.<br/><br/>But these quirks aside, there is a lot of professionalism on board here and a big effort put into making each episode. Series that are constantly on the road are expensive as there are no sets that can be used often and studio work is minimal. Instead viewers get a show that's always bringing new scenery in late 1970's America and the \"on the road\" feel has a big charm about it.<br/><br/>The Las Vegas episode \"The Hulk breaks Las Vegas\" is a personal favorite. Has some knockout Hulk action and a well written and suspenseful near confrontation between McGee and Banner. \"747, The Waterfront story, Terror in Times Square and Life and Death\" are all well written and produced episodes that should give a good example as to why the series has such a good afterlife.<br/><br/>And finally the cast is perfect. I doubt seriously that viewers would be as interested in David's quest had he not been played by Bill Bixby. Not only was Bixby a real quality actor with good range but also an irresistibly appealing guy who you find easy to sympathize with. Jack Colvin is also excellent as McGee, a convincing and charming actor who had a great presence on the episodes he was featured in. And Lou Ferrigno was the best possible choice to play the green giant.

Its legacy and fan base were confirmed years ago. I have yet to see anyone equalling Bill Bixby's interpretation of the slightly tragic David Banner or Lou Ferrigno as the Hulk. The writing and acting standards of \"The Incredible Hulk\" were unprecedented. The emphasis was always on drama and on character. Even the supporting characters were given that bit more shading and depth than usual. With a small regular cast, the series still lasted for five seasons from 1977 to 1982. Personally, I feel that for sheer consistency of good quality, \"The Incredible Hulk\" was at its very best from season one to season three. The fourth season episodes are good and there is a brilliant two part story called \"The First.\" The last seven episodes are OK. It always fascinates me how David Banner can still befriend almost anyone in each episode, in spite of his own problems. It doesn't matter though how settled he becomes in his current surroundings because he knows in his subconscious that he will soon need to move on once again. To add to Banner's problems is the character who is a constant thorn in his side - journalist Jack McGee. From the opening feature length pilot episode, McGee is convinced by the existence of the Hulk after seeing him in person. He constantly hunts down the Hulk creature until it becomes an obsession. The newspaper that McGee works for - The National Register - look upon him as a journalist past his best. This has proved to be the case as McGee has been relegated to covering UFO sightings, supermarket competitions etc. To him, capturing the Hulk might be a chance for the journalist to return to mainstream journalism and he isn't about to give in easily....... David Banner is the kind of person who usually receives unwanted attention where ever he goes. It isn't that he is a criminal type or that he has done anything wrong. It is more a case that he keeps himself to himself and avoids interacting with people sometimes. Whenever he goes to some small town that is in the sticks somewhere, the local residents tend to react to Banner's presence with a degree of suspicion and even hostility. Regardless, Banner is a survivor and determined. The budget was fairly low and the studio backlot was used quite frequently. To me, this isn't a problem. There are far too many great episodes to list but American television didn't get more entertaining than this in some ways. Fans of the \"Incredible Hulk\" comics may not care for this show, seeing as it bears little relation to the comics.

The writing on the Incredible Hulk is fantastic, deep complex characters that make you love or hate them, depending on the situation. The special effects were, pun intended, incredible. You really believe that Lou Ferrigno is smashing through those brick walls, destroying those jeeps and tanks, snapping those guns to bits in his bare hands. Also well played was the relationship between Banner and the Hulk. They were two halves instead of the same whole, unlike the comic books will lead you to believe.

Secret City is a nuanced, understated and never clich\u00e9d blend of political intrigue and personal demons with a satisfyingly Australian flavour. It eschews the over the top melodramatic candy that would've been so easy to stuff down the throats of viewers in an attempt to keep them satiated in favour of a slower, more tantalising meal built layer upon layer leaving the viewer oh so much more satisfied by the end. <br/><br/>It's not just the political intrigue that keeps you on the hook, refreshingly up to date and relevant, mirroring the current position Australia finds itself, historically aligned with the U.S. whilst looking to China to boost trade and economic activity. But the complete multi-faceted nature of the characters. Their motivations are understandable and sympathetic and oftentimes it's their less likable qualities that push and motivate them into traditional protagonist actions. <br/><br/>The portrayal of intelligence gathering and cyber-security is spot on, Secret City even highlights the ability of agencies to use mobile phones as listening and tracking devices even while they're off, an idea that has yet to permeate the public consciousness despite the overwhelming evidence that this is happening in our own world. But herein lies the strength of Secret City, it's not fiction, it's real. Most of what it portrays is not far off from what is happening within the underbelly of Canberra right here and now.

There are two outstanding performances in the series which hold it all together and make the series work. Jacki Weaver is spellbinding as the evil, Machiavellian Attorney General named Catriona Bailey. And the lead role is played by Anna Torv, who has an effortless ability to compel one's attention, and who held together the American series FRINGE (2008, see my review), all 87 episodes of which I watched with bated breath. So she easily handles the mere six episodes of this one. She is such a stalwart lead for a series, that if she is cast, you can know it will work. The plot is exceedingly complex and ingenious. Everyone is betraying everyone, and it is impossible to know who all the good guys are and who the bad guys are, except of course for Anna Torv, who plays a crusading political journalist who is always trying to expose corruption. (And in Australia there is certainly plenty of that, as the Ossies are always complaining about it.) Here the corruption is more to do with insidious political scheming than with financial matters. Weaver wants to establish a police state in Australia with herself in control. For this purpose, she has drawn up an Act to create the Safer Australia Agency, of which she will be the head. She stages false flag operations, has opponents murdered, and manipulates international events to create a climate of fear, so that the Ossies will surrender their civil rights in order to 'be kept safe'. She succeeds in doing this. Draconian laws then come into being which permit people like Anna Torv to be detained indefinitely and imprisoned for the 'offence' of informing the public of the truth about the conspiracies by the Australian Deep State. Sound familiar? Secret courts are established and no one can publicly reveal that he or she has been detained without spending ten years in prison for revealing it. The background to all of this is a simulated threat from China. Weaver is scheming with the Americans to have a military conflict with the Chinese at sea, and stages a false 13 minute 'cyber attack' on Australian air space, leaving everything in the air helpless, both military and civil, then insists it was a Chinese attack on her country. She had secretly given orders through a corrupted general to have various backup units stand down the day before, therefore rendering the nation helpless. Having sufficiently terrified Australia, she gets her bill passed and becomes the shadow dictator of a country whereby the Prime Minister is always the last to know anything critical, while she holds all the cards. Numerous people get killed along with the way, including Torv's ex-husband who has become a woman working for the spy agency. She is played very effectively by Damon Herriman. There is so much intrigue in this gripping series that one hopes that 'Season One' on the front of the DVD means there really will be a Season Two, though so far none is scheduled for production.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "25 out of 36 found this helpful.", "date": "20 July 2017"}, {"title": " Decent series", "content": "I enjoyed this show's first season, for the most part.

I am looking forward to season 2.<br/><br/>Another reviewer wrote this about the show:\n\"...a Conservative leader WAS ELECTED president, Hollywood rebellion is in full force. Every series with a white male lead has been reworked, re 'imagined' essentially turned into the politically CLICHE crap that THIS series is. It's an obvious pattern when everything on the air is either reworked or cancelled to fit one steady story arc / idealistic frame in the writing, casting, and roles for the actors. This is the opposite of equality. This is the start of a culture war.

The show features Ms. Torv as its protagonist.

The scene where the character is stripped searched becomes a prolonged effort without tension to incorporate sexuality into the minds of the unwary.

The slow drawn out sequencing is intent on portraying characters that do not match the scene.

Most of these actors became a distraction. And speaking of distractions, I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who stated there was no reason for the transgender character that distracted from the story. For the first two episodes I wondered why, unless it WAS a transgender character, the studio would pick such an unattractive woman for the part, one who seems to have had a romantic involvement with more than one of the series characters. When, in episode three, the character was finally referred to as a 'he', the mystery was solved. I finally understood that the fact that no mention was made of his orientation showed the powers that be were forcing their agenda on the viewing audience and were no doubt patting themselves on the back for being so politically correct.<br/><br/>It's a shame that such a dramatic thriller should take a back seat to the sexual proclivities of a character.

When he wakes up he finds himself in the seventies. Adjusting to this predicament he still tries to solve crimes (as a cop only lower in rank) the best he can using his knowledge of 2006. At first sight it may seem a sort of remake of seventies cop shows. But after having seen the first season and six episodes of the second season I can tell that it is more than that. Is he imagining all this or is he really experiencing this in order to change the future? He does encounter people he knows from the future,he even meets his parents. He sometimes hears voices,presumably doctors and relatives. Also there is a mysterious man (somebody from another police station) calling him. He seems to be on assignment but doesn't know anything about this. The question is will all these mysteries be solved? When you think you know what is going on something else happens. In that aspect the show is more a thriller. There is no shortage of humour. Gene Hunt is a great character and will make you laugh. He is the exact opposite of Sam Tyler. It is fun to see them arguing about almost anything. But still they gain each others respect. In the second season you will learn that Gene Hunt has his heart in the good place.

'Unusual Police-cum-time travel-cum dark comedy-cum drama' might be a more accurate (if less saleable or say-able) description.<br/><br/>The premise of the show is intriguing; Sam Tyler, a DCI with the Manchester Police in 2006, is investigating a murderer who seems to be eluding him (and may have kidnapped his girlfriend) when he is hit by a car and wakes up in 1973. He has the same name, face, and indeed job, but is now only a DC. This sets up all sorts of interesting possibilities for the writers, not the least of which is an amusing nod to the way that the police, and particularly police dramas, have changed over the years.<br/><br/>We're presented with a number of possible explanations for what's happened; Is he mad? Is some 'other force' driving him like Qunatum Leap's Sam Becket? Or is it just his unconscious mind mulling through the 2006 case and visualising bits of evidence whilst he lies in a coma? The show plays with these ideas by showing apparent connections between the 2006 murders Sam was investigating and similar events he encounters in 1973, snippets of what might (or might not) be the voices of doctors treating him in hospital, and by highlighting the remarkable detail of the 1973 world he is either imagining, or really living in.<br/><br/>There's a bit of rushing around to get all this explained in the first episode granted, but I suspect that's needed to set the thing up (unlike US shows like LOST that run to 24 episodes or so, this thing will probably have to fit itself inside 6). There's also rather too many time travel 'jokes' (\"I need my mobile\", \"Mobile what?\" etc.), which grate a bit after a while, but the transposing of an iPOD with an old 8-track in Sam's car is inspired (and provides the necessary Bowie 'Life on Mars' linkage).<br/><br/>So all in all a promising start to an interesting show.

The character of Jonathan Creek, in spite of his very unique job skills, is so shy and unassuming that he could easily be the quiet neighbor next door. There is no pretention about him, as seen in so many other classic detective-style protagonists. And Alan Davies, with his classical Dickensian-features delivers this remarkable character beautifully and credibly. He is a joy to watch, and endearing to the audience. Jonathan is also a wonderful straight-man for the flamboyant Maddie, played by Caroline Quentin. Maddie is fun, resourceful, and all that much more enjoyable because she's not some twiggy fashion plate. Like Jonathan, Maddie is a very credible character with very human frailties and aspirations. The romantic tension between them is marvellously well paced as they work together, solve mysteries and otherwise drive each other to distraction. The  characters are well developed and far more than 2 dimensional detectives, and the plots are nearly impossible to second-guess.<br/><br/> Of special note is the presence of Anthony Stewart Head playing Adam Klaus at the start of the series. American audiences may mostly recognize him as Rupert Giles on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. But he was deliciously smarmy as the self-indulgent stage magician Klaus, and absolutely wonderful to watch in this series.<br/><br/> Overall, if you're a fan of puzzling whodunits mixed with very fun and unique character concepts, Jonathan Creek is well worth a watch!", "rating": null, "helpful": "5 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "18 September 2001"}, {"title": " Why Can't They Do A Special?", "content": "Can't they do a Johnathon Creek special like they did for The Office?

Jonathan uses his skills of logic to determine exactly what happened, and it is usually the most complex set of incidents. What makes the series so good is the comedy moments. Quentin and Davies are the perfect coupling. My favourite episode would have to be \"Ghost's Forge\". It is brilliantly written, and has a twist where Maddy gets her own back on Jonathan and leaves him with a mystery to solve. The shocking twist at the end though where the mystery is solved was a great case of misdirection. Personally I think it could survive another couple of specials and a series, but much more and the stories will start to dry up and it would lose it's edge. It would be great if a series was made for this year then Caroline Quentin could return for a one-off Christmas special and then put an end to the series, it would be able to go out on a high that way.<br/><br/>Overall I would say this is a fantastic series, but a warning to the writers, you can have too much of a good thing!!", "rating": null, "helpful": "6 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "21 January 2005"}, {"title": " An excellent British comedy drama", "content": "Jonathan Creek is an excellent British Television series - all about mystery and the why's and how's.

This is mostly due to the main character's shyness and retiring nature, played to a \"T\" by Alan Davis. He would be perfectly happy just sitting at home planning tricks for his self absorbed boss but instead keeps getting dragged all over England to confront the British Isle's criminal population, all of whom are unbelievably well versed in stage magic techniques that are elaborately applied to rather unbelievable crimes. The writing is good enough to keep your disbelief dangling on a tight rope.<br/><br/>The downside of the show comes from every character who isn't Creek.<br/><br/>Take the British police who alternate between appreciating Creek's input to being abusive bullies. It's hard to understand how the main character is placed in the universe in the show when that same universe accepts or rejects him depending on whatever inconvenience is needed for the plot.<br/><br/>Then there's Adam Klaus, the magician who Creek works for. In the first season, he's played by Anthony Stewart Head who manages to make a repugnant sex obsessed narcissist seem charming and despite the fact that Tony Head can't do an American accent to save his life, you find him fascinating. But for the rest of the show the character is played by an actual American, Stuart Milligan who doesn't do my home country very proud when he somehow makes Adam Klaus so repellent that his scenes are actually a bear to watch.<br/><br/>It gets worse in the first three seasons with Maddy, played by Caroline Quentin. Maddy is the female lead of the show and Jonathon Creek's possible love interest but they never actually seem to close the deal, either out of neurosis or bad luck. The problem with Maddy is the opposite for the other characters: she's TOO well written, she's too human and broken. Unlike most female leads on tv, Maddy is a real woman with a real human body and down to earth looks. That's great and fun, she's smart and motivated and a great character. But she's also manipulative, cruel, and rather mean to Jonathon and after the first two episodes their \"will they, won't they\" becomes \"God, why should they?\"<br/><br/>Maddy's attitude makes sense when you learn her backstory but it's not much of an excuse for the generally cold blooded way she leaves Jonathon to twist in the wind. Also, despite NEVER actually being a real couple and acknowledging that Jonathon is free to be with who ever he wants, she essentially harangues him mercilessly when he does meet someone.<br/><br/>Maddy leaves after the third season and gets replaced with a series of other female assistants but that's a huge hit to the show because none of the successive assistants are A) As well written and B) getting prettier and prettier to the point that Sarah Alexander plays \"Mrs. Creek\" at the end of the show and it almost seems like a slap in the face to Caroline Quentin to replace her with, well, go look at a picture of Sarah Alexander. Maddy isn't a very GOOD person but she's definitely the soul of the show and it loses something when she's gone.<br/><br/>Alan Creek is also a prime example of the dumbness of British TV's \"scheduling gaps\" between seasons because by the end of the show in 2016, so much time has passed for Alan Davis that he looks like he's melted into a blob of Jonathon Creek shaped goo.

The great model of them all is Sherlock Holmes but many more were invented and developed in detective story literature, especially female specimens like those of Agatha Christie. In this case the main mind, Jonathan Creek, is associated to a woman who is a reporter or writer of some kind. They are only interested in complex cases, especially having to do with some surreal or super-real elements. Jonathan Creek is by profession the technical inventor of a very successful magician, a certain Adam Klaus. So there is always the disappearing of a criminal or of some artifact, or some illusion that has to be placed back in context, and that cannot be explained at all with normal physical considerations. In other words magic. Then the stories always add a personal element about the victims and the people around the victims that is strange too and has to do with some kind of mysterious business often shown as a scam. The object here is to show that most \"magicians\" are nothing but crooks who pretend they are performing something supernatural, only when they are performing a sham, an illusion, a treacherous dishonest act. The stories are extremely inventive and the situation in which Jonathan Creek and his female associate finds themselves are often hairy and frightening. Generally it ends up in the hands of the police except from time to time when they decide it is worth a special treatment. The second Christmas special is typical at that level. Satan's Chimney really is Satan's Chimney. Of course not the Satan you may think of, but quite a different one that has not been living since the Middle Ages, but one of blood and flesh today. That Satan is so perverted that he leads some people into doing some so unnatural things that the name of Satan is by far miles away from his reality. The second quality of this series is that, being a BBC production, it has no advertising and an hour is an hour. I must say that is slightly different from the one hour American series that are reduced to a small 45 minutes, when so much, because of the advertising that is interspersed in the show. The extra fifteen minutes gives the story some depth because they just have the time to build that depth and there is only one enigma in each episode which makes it possible to concentrate on the details, and that once again is a major difference with American series in the field, today imitated by some European series, particularly French series. That's definitely a positive point. If you add to that the acting that is perfect, even at times more than perfect you nearly have a totally admirable picture. But in fact there is another essential element that is 100% British. It is humour (note the spelling of course). At times it is gross, at times it is subtle, or sexual, or political, or whatever but it is humour all right and it gives the series a catching look that you cannot miss. You laugh in the midst of the worst details of the worst crimes you can imagine. Finally we will note the police is practically always shown under a non-negative light, often positive, and some times not too swift. There is a nasty copper from time to time just to spice up the vision.

It was Agnes Nixon's bible for this show which inspired her creation of Rachel (Robin Strasser) on \"Another World\", basing her on the unseen character of Erica Kane. Three years after Rachel's debut on \"AW\", \"AMC\" finally made it to the airwaves; Looking at early pictures of both Strasser and Susan Lucci, one can see why the rumor that they are sisters has flown for years. While untrue (with Phyllis Diller as their mother!), it has created a legend only daytime could produce. In the late 1970's, Lucci and Strasser finally worked together when Strasser played Dr. Christina Karras (who ended up marrying Erica's first husband) prior to joining \"One Life to Live\" as Dorian.<br/><br/>While Lucci is Pine Valley's first lady, she has shared the spotlight with many others, most notably Ruth Warrick as Pine Valley's Grande Dame Phoebe Tyler. While now a wheel-chair bound shell of her former self, during her heyday, Phoebe was a force to be reckoned with, and in the 70's, while in a wheelchair while faking paralysis, \"Citizen Kane\" vet Warrick called herself a \"Bitch on Wheels\". Sadly, Phoebe slipped to back burner after her on-screen husband Louis Edmunds (Langley) was shuffled out of the story (although he is still mentioned as being out of town), but the memory of her confrontations with Erica's beloved mother Mona (the late Fran Heflin) still remain, as do her constant belittlement of the \"less-than-worthy of her time\" members of Pine Valley's other side of the tracks who would end up somehow involved with her younger relatives. \"All My Children\" was the first soap to feature a major black supercouple (Frank and Nancy Grant, followed by their nephew Jesse and his love, Angie), the first to add comedy (Opal Gardner among others) to their front-burner storylines, and the first to truly explore such issues as homosexuality (both male and female), AIDS, and incest. \"All My Children\" has featured many over-the-top villians (most notably Ray Gardner, Billy Clyde Tuggle, Janet Green, and currently Vanessa Cortlandt), actors in dual roles (David Canary, Ellen Wheeler, Michael E. Knight), and actors coming back after their original characters were killed off (Francesca James), or even after they were truly dead (Mike Roy). Where the return of Eve LaRue Callahan (Maria/Maureen) fits into this mold is yet to be seen.<br/><br/>\"All My Children\" has especially been successful in its telling of gothic style storylines, straight out of Edgar Allan Poe, the Bronte Sisters, and Daphne DuMaurier. Palmer Cortlandt (Broadway veteran James Mitchell), his Mrs. Danvers like housekeeper Myra Murdock (the wonderful Elizabeth Lawrence), and his fragile daughter Nina (beautiful Taylor Miller) were created to bring \"AMC\" into the 80's; Later, the equally mysterious Chandler family was created, with David Canary giving one of daytime's legendary performances as the totally different twins Adam and Stuart Chandler; Where Adam is Pine Valley's controlling power broker, Stuart is the heart and soul of the town, taking over where the late Mona Kane and the missing in action Ruth Martin left off. The Dimitri Marrick storyline of the early 1990's was a retread of the Palmer/Daisy Cortlandt storyline, complete with Helga, another Mrs. Danvers style housekeeper who had the gaul to lock Erica in the crypt of her rotting father-in-law. Other storylines, such as former rebellious teenager Hayley Vaughn's transition into the show's major young heroine, freshly copied older storylines. Kelly Ripa took over the storyline Julia Barr (Brooke English) had done 15 years before.<br/><br/>\n\"AMC\" also does not forget long-forgotten characters; We catch occassional glimpses of deceased loved ones such as Natalie Hunter, Jesse Hubbard, Travis Montgomery, Cindy Chandler, and Jenny Gardner Nelson popping up to guide their survivors. Liza Colby, a favorite bad girl of the early 80's, came back over a decade later, with Marcy Walker now playing her as a much reformed Liza. Following soon after was her previously infrequent seen mother Marian (the delightfully humorous Jennifer Bassey) who had long been decorating social events, but hadn't had a storyline since she was discovered to be the murderer of a short-lived Pine Valley villian. Recent returns of Timothy Dillon (actually, Natalie's son by Alex Hunter, adopted by Trevor Dillon) and Angie and Jessie's son Frankie (seen years ago on \"Loving\") are signs that \"AMC\" is keeping this tradition going.<br/><br/>Currently, with the long \"Proteus\" storyline taking a breather with some new directions underway, \"AMC\" is creating new stories for some underused characters (Brooke/Edmund), and introducing some fabulus new roles played by favorites from other soaps. Anna Stuart, introduced as the snooty mother of socialite Greenlee Smythe (the spunky Rebecca Budig), is being built-up as a new love interest for long-time unattached Jackson Montgomery (fan favorite Walt Willey); I can't wait to see Erica's reaction to his new love interest. Marj Dusay, as the always entertaining Vanessa Cortlandt, has been stealing the scenery all year as the drug lord Proteus; Her \"Medea\" like relationship with her sons Leo and David is fascinatingly sick, but like good theater, you just can't turn your head.<br/><br/>\"AMC\" has a very rich history, filled with too many wonderful performances over its 32+ year run; However, who can forget Sandy Gabriel's wealthy and trashy Edna; Candice Earley's tragic performance as reformed hooker Donna Sago Tyler; Kathleen Noone as the wealthy but down-to-earth Ellen Sago; Gillian Spencer as Daisy, the long-lost first Mrs. Palmer Cortlandt; Natalie Ross's ultra-snobby performance as Greg Nelson's disaproving mother Enid; Meg Myles as Adam's obsessive secretary Joanna who was secretly married to Stuart; Jane Elliott as the first gold-digger to swipe Palmer Cortlandt; Genie Francis as the bitchy but tragic incest victim Ceara Connor; Ellen Wheeler as AIDS patient Cindy Chandler, the first woman to show Stuart Chandler how it felt to be truly loved; Susan Pratt as the powerful but otherwise confused Barbara Montgomery Cudahy; Robin Christopher as Skye Chandler (long before she discovered she was really a Quartermain of \"General Hospital\"); and Cadi McLain as dumb country bumpkin turned smart Dixie Cooney, the girl who showed Tad the cad what love really meant. Of the older characters who remain, one of the continuously strongest presences is felt by Eileen Herlie's wise and wonderful Myrtle Lum Fairgate; If only her daughter Rae Cummings (Linda Dano) or granddaughter Skye Quartermain would visit her from their soaps, she would have more to do than play support to Erica, the wonderful Bianca, or Opal.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, most of the male characters pale in comparisson to the above (and many more) female characters; Long-running male characters on the show often become overshadowed by the women in their life; Just take a look at Paul Martin, Linc Tyler, Charles Tyler, Chuck Tyler, Cliff Warner, Benny Sago, Mark Dalton, Tom Cudahy, Jackson Montgomery, Edmund Grey, Dimitri Garrick, well you get the picture. Unforgettable men on the show are either dispicable villians like Ray Gardner, Eddie Dorrance, or Billy Clyde Tuggle, or powerful businessmen like Palmer and Adam. Tad the cad Martin is perhaps the only young character to remain a strong presence; Jesse Hubbard would have gone that direction as well, but died too young. David Hayward is perhaps one of the only more recent characters to actually have a stronger backbone than other characters, but \"AMC\" men tend to mellow too much to make their days in Pine Valley stretch into years. Of course, he's been around for about five years now, which is long considering.....<br/><br/>To sum what I've written up, \"All My Children\" is a story of fascinating characters intertwined with the half-dozen or so who have remained for 20 years or more. The on-going flow of people who affect their lives are always interesting, and with a talented producing and writing team, there are many more to come.", "rating": 6, "helpful": "21 out of 27 found this helpful.", "date": "31 July 2002"}, {"title": " All My Children of the past", "content": "I have watched AMC almost since it began (I was 10), yet just in the last couple of years I have become quite disillusioned.

Now we have plot-driven storylines leaving viewers wondering what happened to their favorite characters and characters that deserve to be punished for their misdeeds are still roaming around town acting self-righteous.  And I cannot get over how Tad and Dixie fans have been screwed over and over again because after 13 years, they still do not have a child.  They are the only supercouple in daytime that I can think of that does not have a child together.  How incredibly unfair is that David and Anna (a couple that has been together for barely a year) get to have a child while Tad and Dixie have been trying forever yet prove unsuccessful. When talking about AMC, I guess the name that will be most associated with it is Susan Lucci.  She is an original cast member and have been in front burner storylines.  Anyone who is an AMC watcher knows Erica's long line of men whom she has married and/or dated.  I will always prefer Erica with Jackson, who I think is the love of her life.  It's funny that a lot of fans think that Erica and Jack have been married.  They haven't.  They've been engaged though.  So everytime the powers that be throw a new love interest into Erica's storyline, they are ignoring what could be a great storyline for Erica and Jack.  I still have hopes that they will rekindle their love though! The Martins have been a prominent family of Pine Valley since the show started so it's sad that they are barely on now.  Ruth and Joe only come out during the holidays.  Tad has been acting like a moron ever since Dixie died.  Why he defends Liza for every misdeed she does yet criticize Adam for everything he does I never know.  That just really irks me.  The way Tad was acting all self-rigteous towards Brooke for sleeping with Adam.  Hey Tad you shouldn't be the one talking; you slept with Liza remember?  And why everyone in the town blames Adam for every single thing is just plain wrong. Liza is the one who embezzled money from Chandler Enterprises yet it's Adam's fault?  I don't understand the logic. I think I should just stop ranting about what has become of AMC and reminsence about the good times.  The first storyline that Tad and Dixie had together will always be my favorite storyline.  The way that Tad Martin, formerly known as Tad the cad, helped Dixie when she was being manipulated by Adam.  Their courtship was so sweet.  Michael E. Knight and Cady McClain have one of the most natural and electrifying chemistry in daytime.  They play off each other well and their scenes can be humorous or a total tear-jerker.  Who was not laughing their butt off at the Tad love test yet who was able to have a dry eye after watching the scene where Dixie is being hauled off to the looney bin?

When the show ended in 2011, I was somewhat sad, given that the disappearance of most soap operas was due to the arrival of cheaply produced reality shows, not so much a lack of ratings.

Lucci was within months of being eligible for Medicare by that time, and although she was remarkably well preserved, all good things must come to an end.<br/><br/>One of the big changes in soap operas to come around was in the mid 1970s when soaps began to introduce wealthy dynastic families and business power struggles as the center of the story lines versus ordinary people dealing with infidelity, divorce, sex and pregnancy before marriage - things that in general were discussed among the actresses playing housewives at the kitchen table over a cup of coffee. All My Children introduced first the Cortlandts to fill that spot in the late 1970's and then Adam Chandler as a rival businessman to the Cortlandts, with bad blood going back to the West Virginia hills from which both families came and the feud having very personal roots.<br/><br/>Finally there is Phoebe, who was the matriarchal version of Erica, who thought that her blue blood and full bank accounts made her better than anybody else and that she knew best for all concerned, and had no more problem meddling in other people's lives than Erica did. Played by Ruth Warrick, she did a splendid job at the role from the show's inception until then end of her life when her illness made her unable to continue regular appearances.<br/><br/>Several acting careers started here - Sara Michele Gellar, for example, later became the star of the long running TV series \"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\". Several acting careers ended here with good long running parts such as Ruth Warrick as Phoebe Tyler, David Canary as Adam Chandler, and James Mitchell as Palmer Cortlandt.<br/><br/>Here is where I usually say \"catch it if you can\", but you can't since the only soap opera ever put on DVD was \"Dark Shadows\", and there isn't even a Soap Net channel anymore because so few soap operas still exist. Look for the remains of this show on youtube. Some enterprising individuals have put some portions even from the early 1970's out on youtube. I don't know what they were using in the early 70s to record. Was there such a thing as a squirrel powered Betamax in 1970?", "rating": 8, "helpful": "2 out of 2 found this helpful.", "date": "17 May 2016"}, {"title": " \"You're Losing Her, Palmer. She's Just Like Her Mother.\"", "content": "Oh, where to go in reflecting on this 41-yr-old show. <br/><br/>Yes, it has given us the names of Phoebe, Erica, Courtland, Opal (Dorothy Lyman from the moment she squawked, \"ooh, it's hot on this bus!\"), and couples like Cliff &amp; Nina, Greg &amp; Jenny, Jesse &amp; Angie. <br/><br/>But in my past 48-hr reflection, it seems to me this hearty program missed more marks than it hit. lol! No, no, it's okay. There were definitely some major pluses along the way. <br/><br/>I started with the show when it was ten-yrs-old. By then, Phil and Tara were just being removed (He was missing, she ran off with Jim Jefferson, a fellow in a striped pullover). <br/><br/>Dr. Chuck Tyler and hooker Donna Beck were married and in full-swing. In fact, that's the best place to begin. Donna couldn't have a kid, so she was going to get one off the black-market. \"Once Chuck sees the baby, he'll fall in love with him.\" Didn't happen. Chuck got mad and they split up. Chuck married Carrie Sanders, Donna fell into a romance with Palmer Courtland (one of the wildest romances the show ever had). On a ski trip, Chuck and Donna are trapped in a cave, so they have sex. A child is conceived. What Donna didn't know is Palmer was sterile after a riding accident (and having his two kids), so he always knew he wasn't the father. Donna has the baby after FIVE MONTHS! So now Chuck and Donna have a kid. Guess what? The kid is killed in a night club fire. <br/><br/>This was always what AMC did. Even with that night club fire, we had Greg Nelson in a wheelchair, Ray Gardner was blind, Erica was locked in a dressing room and Chuck had left the baby in Donna' dressing room (she sang in the club). I started back to school, got out early, came home to see who was saved, and everyone was out of the club, the baby was the only fatality. Missed it all in thirty minutes. <br/><br/>The same thing would happen when Ray Gardner was going to blow up the Martin family on Christmas. I wanted to see the house blow up. Same setup. Started back to school after Christmas, came home early, missed thirty minutes of the show. House was intact, Ray blew himself up. Utter disappointment. <br/><br/>Early on, the show truly had some of the trashiest characters around, such as Ray Garnder, Billy Clyde Tuttle (married in real life to Christine Baranski, I believe), purehearted prostitute Estelle and a fave of mine, tho I don't think she was a hooker, Edna, a total nutcase. <br/><br/>Oh, yes, and Myrtle Fairgate; her brilliant turn trying to help Phoebe by warning her Langley Wallingford was an imposter. This woman raced to the church on foot, but didn't make it in time. <br/><br/>For me, a grand minus has definitely been Adam Chandler. In the entire time he has been on the show, it has been one little girl after another (Dixie, Gloria, Liza, etc.), making each woman look more and more stupid for falling for this man with his track record. Why any of these women would have anything to do with him after Dixie and Brooke alone is beyond me. Each one was just another 'hes trying to control you' bit. <br/><br/>This pretty much led to the total ruination of Marcy Walker's Liza Colby. Walker didn't like the early on schoolgirl image she had on AMC(not that the forgettable wispy haired Eden Capwell on Santa Barbara was any better), but upon returning and hooking up with Adam? The promise in Liza was that she could have gone on to rival Ercia Kane. <br/><br/>Definitely this was AMC's major problem. Palmer Courtland and Adam Chandler should have paired up with characters like Marion Colby and Enid Nelson (one of the most annoying women around), then with these guys as parents, the young people of Pine Valley wouldn't stand a chance! Marion did eventually marry a Chandler, but it was daffy brother Stuart. <br/><br/>But again, the minuses were always there. AMC mocked the 'chased by bad guys' bit popularized by Luke &amp; Laura from General Hospital (after doing a couple of Lovers On The Run story lines theirselves) by having Tad, Dottie, Greg, Jesse, whoever, running from bad guys encircling a monument, and other characters (a woman with a baby carriage, etc.) end up joining in to slapstick music. If the show didn't take things seriously, how could viewers?<br/><br/>I was recalling Angie's parents, played by Lee Chamberlain (Electric Comany) and Antonio Vargas (Starsky &amp; Hutch). All that objection to Jesse and then Dad turns out to be running a black market baby scheme anyway. And Mike Minor (Petticoat Junction) as Brandon Kingsley. <br/><br/>And I never recall seeing another show have to recast in mid-story as AMC did, from Mrs. Gonzales, the hispanic landlady who helped Jesse and Jenny (she changed in mid dramatic moment), to Mike Roy, should have been Erica's true love, another actor had to do the death scene. <br/><br/>And where on Earth did Natalie (Kate Collins) come from? I was trying to recall this. I think she was a rival for Erica somewhere in there. She never really carried much weight, did she? Some Kent Bogard, Lars Bogard storyline. I think Lars ended up a Nazi and the agent for models, Olga, was his sister? <br/><br/>And another biggie, Brooke's mother, played by Patricia Barry, ended up the big villianess, Cobra. There was Phoebe's sister-in-law. Too hilarious. <br/><br/>No, it wasn't a bad run, I will say that. Been some fun moments, lots of fun moments. The gang was missed anyway, Palmer, Nina, Jenny, Daisy, but they have provided some hearty memories.", "rating": null, "helpful": "2 out of 2 found this helpful.", "date": "23 September 2011"}, {"title": " A Long Time Viewer...But...", "content": "I am not sure when I started watching AMC...but I believe it was when an aunt came down to spend a summer with me..she watched several...but it is AMC that I recall most.

I stopped watching All My Children years ago because it was really the Susan Lucci show. Nowadays, the show is going to the dogs literally. It focuses too much on the young people of Pine Valley. I remember the early eighties when Ruth Warrick and other cast members like Kay Campbell, Louis Edmonds, Julia Barr, David Canary, and Eileen Herlie all had some storyline going now. Those who survive are destined to be placed in the background like Michael Knight. The show is only a shell of what it used to be. I sent several letters and applications for Eileen Herlie to get a British National Honor like Dame but I would have settled for the typical M.B.E. (Member of the Order of the British Empire). I sent several envelopes to cast members with an application inside. I never heard from one cast member or anybody interested in honoring Eileen Herlie from her native country. It angers me because I know from the past that somebody in their eighties like her and Ruth Warrick don't have much time left. I even sent the same applications to soap publications. Still no response from anybody. Does anybody care about somebody like Eileen Herlie? Before Anna Lee, I made several attempts to get another honor from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth but it failed because I didn't do it sooner than later. Eileen should have an M.B.E. like Anna Lee who was awarded in 1982. Eileen has been on just as long as some of the recipients from Coronation Street. Still, I wanted to see Ruth's tribute but for some reason, I didn't. Maybe I wasn't supposed too, maybe this is why I am writing this piece. I will never say the writing was ever excellent. It never held the same appeal as Douglas Marland or William J. Bell's story lines. The acting has always been either wonderful comedic and truly over the top.

Originally it was a multi-generational, multi-layered story set in the mythical town of Pine Valley, Pennsylvania. Created by Agnes Nixon,it dealt with real-life social issues--- drug abuse, racism, rape,domestic violence,prostitution, even homelessness. The characters came from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities. There were the rich, upper-class Tyler and English families as well as the middle-class Martins, and also the working-class Benny Sago and Mrs. Valentine. It also had social outcast Donna Beck, a runaway teen prostitute, and her outrageous pimp Billy Clyde Tuggle. But the most popular character, a break-out character really, was Susan Lucci's Erica Kane.<br/><br/>From the start Erica stole the show. She debuted in 1970 as a teenager from a broken home. She started out with Daddy issues and a great big chip on her shoulder. Good writing soon transformed her into something more human,and as the decades passed we learned more about her troubled history. As we eventually discovered, she'd been raped at age 14 by a pedophile friend of her father's, apparently with Dad's full consent! Ever since that event Erica has had emotional problems. Despite her worldly success she's still struggling, 40 years later, to like herself. No amount of male attention is ever enough, which would explain her long string of discarded husbands and lovers. She's a fascinating, complex character and according to Lucci herself, great fun to play. Lucci portrays Erica with a light comedic touch, and her long-time fans continue to love her.<br/><br/>Looking back, I remember the 1980's and 1990's as AMC's Glory Years. Inspired writing, along with a superb cast of actors, guaranteed that. During this period the show introduced two new families: the Cortlandts and the Chandlers. These were rich, powerful clans with bigger-than-life patriarchs---Palmer Cortlandt and Adam Chandler, respectively--- continually at each other's throats.Palmer was a cold-blooded s.o.b. who lived in a Gothic mansion with his captive daughter, Nina. Similarly, Adam wielded power from the Chandler Mansion and soon emerged as the villain we loved to hate.<br/><br/>Over the years Adam's manipulations have driven away all of his wives--- he has had several, including Erica and the redoubtable Brooke English-- -and he also has alienated his children. Today's son and heir, JR, is a recovering alcoholic with deep-seated problems that he's likely to \"hand down\" to the next generation. Stay tuned.<br/><br/>Another memorable character was, and still is, Tad Martin. An abandoned child, he was adopted by the Martin family nearly 40 years ago. Later he grew up to be the adult Tad that we all adore. Young Tad was a womanizer and a cad yet likable because of his wit and charm. After numerous escapades he found true love with sweet Dixie Cooney, and the fans applauded. Other popular pairings kept us riveted: Cliff and Nina...Greg and Jenny...Angie and Jessie...Natalie and Trevor. Angie and Jesse achieved special distinction in being the first official black Super Couple ever seen on daytime. Jesse's now a p.i. and Angie's a doctor. Watching them interact with their old pal Tad, from adolescence to middle age, has been a joy. <br/><br/>But all good things must come to an end. Once Disney bought AMC, in the early 2000's, this iconic show went into a downward tailspin. New people were running it now, people who apparently knew nothing about soaps. The writing regime changed every year or so, with character history violated or simply ignored. The scribes gave us short-term \"shock and awe\" story lines that made no sense. One of the worst was Erica's hitherto unknown son, an aborted fetus kept alive by a mad scientist...Yeah, right. And then the horrendous tale of Tad, our beloved Tad, burying a man alive! Not to mention the travesty of Dixie's death by poisoned pancakes. After Head Writer Megan McTavish killed off Dixie, for no apparent reason, there was a general outcry from the viewers. AMC was in deep trouble, and sinking fast...<br/><br/>Yet even in recent years the show has had its redeeming features. The Kane family, for one. Erica's two daughters have been skillfully woven into the Pine Valley tapestry. Kendall (the child of rape) appeared on Mom's doorstep with an initially bad attitude but has since evolved into a charming if somewhat wacky heroine. Bianca, the younger child, \"came out\" as a lesbian back in 2000 in one of the best scenes I've ever seen on daytime. The hard-won but close sisterly bond between \"Binks\" and Kendall, and their coming to terms with their celebrity Mom, has been masterly storytelling.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding All My Children is currently on life support, like so many other soaps. Why? The main problem, I suspect, lies in its dearth of good old-fashioned romance. The only Super Couple left seems to be \"Zendall\"---Kendall and Zach---and with Zach's portrayer, Thorsten Kaye, about to leave the show, even that will soon be gone. But please, no more \"Rylee\" (Greenlee and Ryan)! \"Rylee\" is an uninspired pairing that the fans in overwhelming numbers hate, yet the Disney suits have been kicking that dead horse for years. When the chemistry ain't there, folks, it just ain't there. Greenlee, a delightful bitch, had a great romance years ago with con artist Leo Dupres, played by actor Josh Duhamel, but with Ryan she fizzles. I'd rather see her reunited with her dastardly hubby, David Hayward, who we all know isn't really dead. In fact, even as we speak, Dr. Hayward may be resurrecting corpses in his secret lab...SPOILER ALERT! <br/><br/>ADDENDUM: A few years after my writing this review the Head of ABC Daytime, Brian Frons, cancelled AMC, causing an angry backlash from the fans. And so now, alas, Pine Valley is just a bittersweet memory. Erica will never break another heart, Adam will never negotiate another dirty deal, and Tad's sparkling wit is heard no more.

In particular, congratulations to Mark Ryan - who became Nasir the Saracen. Due to be killed off at the end of the the first episode, he was so good, that he remained as a permanent cast member.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, the series' immediate appeal was due to the amazing on-screen chemistry between its two leads, Michael Praed and the beautiful Judi Trott as (the first) Robin and his Marion. Praed's youthful, dark, good looks had an almost 'fey' quality which made the magical element entirely believable. (And by 'fey' I don't mean to imply any loss of masculinity.) The first two seasons - with Praed - were by far the best.<br/><br/>\nIn the third season, Jason Connery had a hell of a task following an actor so perfect for the Robin role, but he did reasonably well and the strong ensemble cast carried the change of lead well. Richard Carpeneter's wise decision to make the new 'Robin Hood' a completely different character with a completely different background was a very wise move.<br/><br/>I suppose any review should mention the immense debt Costner's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves owes to Robin of Sherwood. Some might say that 'debt' was putting it mildly! Costner not only retained the Saracen (who until Nasir had never been a Robin Hood character at all) but he filmed in many of the same locations; used the same horsemaster (Stevie Dent) and clung to the magical elements - though being a good old American boy stuck to the idea of Christianity good - old religion bad, whereas Robin of Sherwood often showed the political corruption of the Church (historically accurate)and the simple spirituality of the old religion (unrelated to 'black' magic).

The Sheriff Of Nottingham breaks away from the usual mustache-twirling, scenery-eating bad guy, and has more in common with a corrupt politician than his previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Michael Praed's Robin Of Loxley was certainly a better Robin than Jason Connery's, but that isn't to take anything away from Connery. Praed's swansong in \"The Greatest Enemy\" is one of the best episodes of any TV show I have seen in such a long time. <br/><br/>Richard Carpenter's knowledge of both the legend of Robin Hood and beliefs in England at that time clearly show here - and it goes without saying that if the people behind \"Prince Of Thieves\" had this much insight and knowledge of the source material, their \"Raw-bin Hood\" would not have been so dismal. Blatantly stealing elements from RoS, and yet ignoring others make this film merely a pale imitation of RoS.<br/><br/>Without wanting to sound harsh, Connery seems to have been chosen to garner a little publicity for this often under-rated show; the son of a former incarnation of Robin Hood playing a modern-day Robin Hood. Connery handles the part extremely well, but isn't the actor Praed was. That said, I do prefer the third season episodes and stories to the first two series'. No one would envy having to follow in the footsteps of a role made famous by someone else for two series, and there is - as in all the series' - an excellent camaraderie and relationships - between Robin, his Merry Men and his Merry Woman. <br/><br/>The addition of the \"old religion\" trying to continue, while the new religion of Christianty tries its hardest to stamp it out. It's ironic that this reminds me of \"Prince Of Thieves\" in relation to RoS: borrowing a lot of elements from the original, and tweaking them a little.

Since I grew up watching this by many fires on misty and snow bound nights, it is probably my favorite telling of the Robin Hood story.<br/><br/>What I liked best about this show growing up and still like best (although I do have more appreciation for Judi Trott) was the mysticism of the show. All the other tellings told of Robin Hood's rise to heroism and then his ultimate triumph and then that was it and while it was certainly fun, this series seemed to have more meat to its bones because of its introducing all those mythical elements. The music was also pretty cool, haunting and beautiful.<br/><br/>After watching this and \"Excalibur\" one misty day, I noticed that some of the myths here were similar to Arthurian legend. Herne is to both Robin Hoods (Praed, Connery) what Merlin was to King Arthur. And the two Robins are later given a magic sword, Albion (which later became the name of our family dog).<br/><br/>The show ran for about 4 seasons I think, the first two featured Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley, and the last two featured his successor, Robert of Huntington, played by Jason Connery (Sean's son; Sean also played Robin Hood in case you didn't know, in \"Robin &amp; Marion\" opposite Audrey Hepburn's Maid Marion). But both Michael and Jason's characters become known as Robin Hood and/or the Hooded Man. I was surprised to read in the archives of reviews that many people prefer Jason over Michael, since people often get more attached to the first guy (maybe it's name recognition). I think they're both capable actors and they both brought something different to the show, but while Michael and Jason's Robin Hoods were both likable characters, I think I like Michael better as he had that dark, brooding intensity about him. This is not to say that Jason, while more of a pretty boy, did not have his moments (the best part of Jason's reign was watching him struggle to prove he was a worthy successor). What I find ironic is that Jason's character, Robert/Robin 2, has the noble man who rejects his heritage origin that is often attributed to Michael's character, Robin of Loxley.<br/><br/>\nThe rest of the cast was great too. Judi Trott was a beautiful and believable Marion who had to stand up to have a place for herself in Sherwood. Ray Winstone was an intense and dangerous Will Scarlet. Clive Mantle was a lovable Little John, as was Phil Rose as Friar Tuck, Peter L. Williams as Much, and Mark Ryan as the strong silent type, Nasir. Nikolas Grace was a great Sheriff, Robert Addie an over the top Gisbon.<br/><br/>A great show with great stories and a great cast.

But the characters are anything but the swashbuckling cardboard heroes that the Robin Hood stereotype embodies, and we have come to expect.<br/><br/>Michael Praed (in my mind, the perfect Robin Hood), plays a fallible, conflicted Robin, who is nonetheless idealistic and strong.  All of the Merry Men are fleshed out as full characters, with their own motivations and ideas, and Marion (Judi Trott) is represented particularly well.  She avoids many female stereotypes: she is beautiful but not plastic, a fighter but still definitely feminine.  The Sheriff of Nottingham (Nicholas Grace) and Guy of Gisburne (Robert Addie) are present as the classic villains, but they both go far beyond the usual limited parameters of these roles.<br/><br/>The characters are all comfortable and unselfconscious, as though they don't realize that they are legends.  To me, this is their most appealing trait of all.<br/><br/>The creators of the show also deserve kudos for their brave move in replacing Michael Praed when he opted out after two seasons:  instead of recasting another actor in the same role, a different Robin Hood was introduced -- a man of noble background (played by Jason Connery-- yes, the son of *that* Connery)as opposed to the peasant upbringing of Michael's Robin.  The show thereby manages to address both accounts of Robin Hood's origin.  (Many people prefer Jason's Robin.  I personally still gravitate toward Michael.  It is an ongoing debate among fans.)<br/><br/>Even after all this time, the show still has a devoted cult following, who gather for yearly conventions with the stars.

I loved it when I saw it back in -91 -92, when I was about 12. I love it as much, or more, today, which is remarkable considering my (hopefully) improved film appreciation and criticism skills. Most of the movies I liked back then I'm not that fond of today, besides for the nostalgia factor.

First, the picture and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first couple of episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes, although I know that was not an option in this case.<br/><br/>So, on to the good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. I don't think I have seen him in a single role since then, which only strengthen this fact for me. He delivers such a believable performance as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task replacing him. The fact that Michael Praed hasn't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable. Or perhaps that was his fate, to do this one role perfectly, then disappear.<br/><br/>I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. He is really not a complex character, but totally rotten. The relation between him and Gisburne is just hilarious. Actually, just looking at de Rainault sitting in his throne, bored, glaring, makes me laugh even before he has said anything. Another actor that deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in films as The Departed and Beowulf). There are a lot of other great actors here, too.<br/><br/>I love the portrayal of the Robin gang. They are having fun, playing, laughing, you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this. Those bonding scenes are so important.<br/><br/>I think that it being UK produced with British actors really made it better, compared to for example the -92 feature film version with Kevin Costner, that just feels fake, fake, fake. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on..) The cast being able to speak English with British accent makes it more believable, and I get the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and writers, behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. The music is another of those things they just nailed.<br/><br/>An exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there. It's not over the top, but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also love how nicely the mix of comedy, adventure and drama is blended.<br/><br/>Those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine.

It was really like nothing I had ever seen before. Other TV series seemed just to have the actors do their thing and then film it. Obviously I know that there's more to it, but in RoS almost every frame has an artistic quality; the colours, compositions and overall aesthetic effects are remarkable, even if the technical quality is less than stellar. Or perhaps it is exactly because the series lacks the high gloss of a Hollywood production that it is so eye-catching. This may also be the reason why the locations look so real. Many of the landscape images are so vivid that I feel I could step right into the scene and go for a walk - the arrival at Kirklee Abbey, for example. At the same time, the places also seem surreal, dreamlike and beyond this world, and I'm not just talking about the colour filters and dry ice mist.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Michael Praed. I don't know how I can praise his performance enough. His Robin is grounded and earthy and has an intense physical presence (well, let's be honest and call it swoon-inducing), yet at the same time he is ethereal and otherworldly to a degree that rivals Galadriel. I have seen him described as \"fey\" and that might be the most fitting word. He is so young and vulnerable and overwhelmed with the task allotted to him, and he is fierce and determined and, well, incredibly brave. In his early fighting scenes, he looks scared just as if, you know, he was doing this for the first time. When he encounters Marion in her bed chamber, his upper lip is glistening with sweat, because he has just been running for his life. Observe him in the duel with the Templar: he looks terrified. And then again he in turn can look terrifying: just think of the scene when he is bewitched by Lilith and tells Much to cut his bonds. Praed displays a wonderful variety and subtlety of facial expressions, and his rare smiles are utter enchantment. More than anything else, it is his warmth and affection for his friends that make him so irresistible. ***SPOILER*** No other fictional character's death has ever wrenched my heartstrings like Robin's. Praed is not a hard act to follow; he is an impossible act to follow. Sorry, Jason.<br/><br/>Judi Trott perfectly matches Praed in the sense that her Marion is simultaneously gritty and elfin. She is as beautiful as a Pre-Raphaelite Madonna and yet convincingly down-to-earth in her woodland outfit. She is feisty and can kick ass with the best of them but remains sensitive and gentle-hearted. The interactions between Marion and Robin are full of tenderness and I adore it that the love-at-first-sight thing is conveyed by having them talk from the first moment as if they've known each other for ages. They work flawlessly as a team. A great scene is when Marion visits Robin in the dungeons in The Words of Wayland and they combine caresses with an exchange of crucial information. I also love it that Marion is so at ease with the other Merries and thinks nothing of cuddling John or stroking Much's hair while he rests his head on her lap. She does this in a casual and entirely innocent way; she has thrown in her lot with a bunch of rough guys and has taken them to her heart like a sister.<br/><br/>All the Merries are great, each in their own way. Mark Ryan as Nasir was my teenage favourite, probably because he was taciturn and mysterious and of course, awesomely cool. Clive Mantle and Ray Winstone did an excellent job portraying strong men in their own right who follow Robin out of love and loyalty but are not afraid to confront him and argue with him when he is wrong. Peter Llewellyn Williams had perhaps the toughest part, playing a character that was routinely underrated. It would have been great to see him grow up more, but the script didn't seem to provide for that. Well, I still dig Nasir, but nowadays Friar Tuck is probably my favourite Merry after Robin and Marion. He has an adorable accent and some of the funniest lines, and Phil Rose's body language and facial expressions are priceless.<br/><br/>It is a rare thing in my experience to have villains who are absolutely loathsome but whom I nevertheless enjoy watching. Gisbourne and de Rainault are complete scum; cruel, selfish, callous, arrogant, black-hearted scoundrels beyond redemption. And yet they are highly entertaining and wonderfully funny in their weird co-dependent relationship full of frustrations on either side. Nickolas Grace succeeds in giving the Sheriff a certain degree of dignity, bat-crazy though he seems most of the time. And Robert Addie makes such good use of his impressive hurt-puppy look that in spite of all my loathing I did at times feel sorry for him. As a teen, I never picked up on the homoerotic vibes between them, obvious as they are; as an adult I find them a fascinating ingredient in the overall mix.<br/><br/>The traditional tales of Robin Hood offer material for sound action adventures which, quite frankly, wouldn't have interested me much as a teenage girl and even less so as a middle-aged woman. Whoever had the idea to include paganism and elements of fantasy was a genius. Blending these aspects with the medieval setting is what gave the series its unique charm.<br/><br/>So much more could be praised about the series.

Some years later I would take my dog Cedric through the same woods and think about the series as I walked through the still recognisable locations (The remnants of the village were still visible in Vassels Park). Sometimes I would see Phil Rose (who played Friar Tuck) in a club I used to frequent on a Friday or Saturday night called The Alexander Club (now renamed The Luna Club) in Clifton Bristol.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should organise tours of these locations for the faithful; just like many towns have ghost walks or history walks!!!

Everything about this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not.<br/><br/>It paints a picture of a Europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism, as most of the villagers still have their local deities, and there are Satan worshipping nuns, and magi, witches and sorcerers casting spells.<br/><br/>However, what comes to the fore most, is that it's a series of it's time. Rather than the version of the fifties, which was a lament against centralized government and the McCarthy era persecutions, this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s, Thatcherist bleakness, and has a strong environmentalist leaning. Robin's protector is a nature worshipper called Hern The Hunter, who often appears wearing the head of a deer, and is a personification (as is this Robin) of The Green Man, an alternative version of Osiris (the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection - it is interesting to note that in these series, Robin In The Hood isn't a person, but a concept; when the old one is killed, a new one is summoned telepathically by Hern - the person may die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, hence the concept of resurrection).<br/><br/>The music and score are really outstanding, and performed by the Irish formation, Clannad. When watching it, I couldn't help but think how _boring_ authentic medieval Anglosaxon folk music would have been. :-)<br/><br/>All this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of Wales, which pass for The New Forrest.<br/><br/>The only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series, the actors have to overcome their own skepsis, and convince themselves that this really is a serious work. After that, they get into it and the acting is great! Michael Praed as the first Robin (the second is played by Sean Connery's son, Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded Marion, Phil Rose as the portly and really kind-hearted friar Tuck, Ray Winstone as the volatile and lovelorn Scarlet, Clive Mantle as the giant shepard Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as Little John's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard, and Mark Ryan as the ex-Hashashin/Assassin Nazir - all of them giving great performances. Also great are the steady Bad Guys, Nicholas Grace as the bug-eyed, scheming Sheriff of Nottingham, and his aristocratic, bumbling sidekick (and Robin's half brother, as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne.

That does mean it will never look as good as a movie shot on 35mm, but there is no excuse for the extremely poor digital transfer that Network has made. The picture is full of grossly obvious digital artifacts (primarily \"blocking\"). This is due to poor compression encoding, not the source material. I have a better quality transfer that was made from the 1950's Richard Greene Robin Hood series, purchased on a DVD that cost one dollar. The source material for Robin of Sherwood couldn't have been worse than that but the DVD looks worse. I don't even see how this can be blamed on trying to squeeze too much on to each disc. Three episodes plus another hour of bonus materials is not much more than the four episodes on each disc in a Star Trek set and the quality of those is excellent. <br/><br/>The DVD set does provide an eclectic and engrossing set of bonus materials.

This means that the cartoonist was the unofficial Grandaddy of Goth! When the concept of converting these ink doodles into a live action television program took place, the timing coincided with another \"odd\" family who also arrived on our Television doorsteps that same season: \"The Munsters.\" In a way, that was a disservice to both programs, since the common traits they shared made them a constant comparison. Personally, though I don't believe they are in the same league.<br/><br/>Where \"The Munsters\" went for the slapstick schtick nearly every time, \"The Addams Family\" used more wordplay and more clever, witty attempts to bring a laugh. But even that wasn't the main difference between the programs.<br/><br/>The secret ingredient that The Addams Family had over their Mockingbird Lane counterparts was a single word: PASSION. Yes this was a family with a creepy home, kooky hobbies, mysterious eating habits, and spooky pets. But at the root, at the heart, at the altogether ooky core of the story was this one, great, huge love between Gomez and Morticia and the love they shared for all of the people in their lives. John Astin and Carolyn Jones were incredible, and for my money, are still the sexiest couple in TV history.<br/><br/>Though it was often played for laughs, as when the matriarch uttered a word in French and Gomez couldn't resist kissing up her arm, it was very palpable, in the pet names they called each other, in the way they tangoed or in how the pair chatted in each other's company. This was a family that cared about all of its members deeply, and that read as clear as a full moon over a cemetery.<br/><br/>The laughs of the program were just the spider on the web, and the laughs were plentiful and great.

However,\"The Munsters\" was on a rival network-CBS,and it starred Fred Gwynne and Yvonne DeCarlo and produced 70 episodes,all in black and white and was produced by Universal Television and Kayro-Vue Productions and filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood. That series ran from September 24,1964 until May 12, 1966.<br/><br/>\"The Addams Family\" starred John Astin and Carolyn Jones was on ABC-TV and ran for two seasons,producing 65 episodes,all in black and white from September 18, 1964 and ending its run on April 8, 1966. The show was produced by Filmways Productions in Hollywood. Based on the cartoon characters created by Charles Addams under executive producers Nat Perrin and David Levy along with Al Simon,this series was indeed hilarious but very interesting to captured the surroundings involving the characters in the Addams' household. This was an excellent-counter cultural 60's show. First off,actors John Astin and Carolyn Jones brought Charles Addams' cartoon characters to life in this series in which they brought there own qualities to the characters they portrayed. John Astin brought his Zen Yogi Buddhism and his Shakespeare while Carolyn Jones was just gothically gorgeous with her knitting and great looks not to mention a great sing-songy voice that brings the dialogue to life,and a perfect figure to fit brilliantly into that black widow dress. Astin's character was Gomez Addams,a successfully wealthy tycoon who was happily married,dripping with Old World charm, was very devoted to his loving kids and was very loving to them,kind relatives(who were strange at times),a devoted butler,and the whole family did everything there way,including times where Gomez had the knack to blowing up train sets in his house and other weird stuff! Then,you have the children Wednesday and Pugsley(played with perfection by Ken Weatherwax and Lisa Loring)who were always into something or another,and also the butler Lurch(Ted Cassidy)with his Basso Profundo groan every time Mr. and Mrs. Addams would pulled the chime that shook the entire house(with a pull cord a full sized hangman's noose)when he would answer,\"You rang?\" There were other little touches that the show had,which was something that its rival \"The Munsters\" never had....The coffee table with bundles of $100 bills in the drawer,the torture chamber turned into a play room for the children and for Uncle Fester,the quirky decor of the house and family taking in the moon while others took in the sun. Also there was times when Morticia and Gomez had a implied sex life(and the first sitcom couple to do that...which you would never seen that on other sitcoms during the 1960's)which was rather kinky and outrageously funny.<br/><br/>Then there was the unpredictable Uncle Fester(Jackie Coogan)who was always experimenting on different things,and was the strangest character of them all,but in perspective,Jackie Coogan brought that role to life and the results are absolutely brilliant to what he did with the character. Then,there was the Grandmother or Grand ma-ma,and the strangest characters imaginable...Thing(which was a hand inside a box that delivered the family mail),and not to mention Cousin Itt(a relative of Morticia's with lots of hairy features)who would speak and communicate with unmentionable terms,and by the way,what would Cousin Itt be like without all that hair? something I would not like to find out.<br/><br/>This series came out at the explosion of the youth rebellion that was to come...and this series along with its fierecest competition,\"The Munsters\",which was on a rival network may have precipitated it at the level of total of the psychedelic movement that was to come after that series went off the air in 1966. The 1960's had a lot of counter culture and developed an impact to the actual culture which sparked an explosion of \"hippie\" freedom and expression of the mid to late-60's and to the \"gothic\" look and it can be traced directly to here. Also, to point out there is a lot of subversive dialogue that was in the series on many levels and check out some of the episodes where this has occurred. However,the musical theme by composer Vic Mizzy was brilliant on all levels,since Mizzy was a jazz composer who went big with many of the TV-themes of its era including \"Green Acres\",and several theatrical features starring Don Knotts from the mid-1960's and composed themes for several Saturday Morning cartoons.<br/><br/>However,when The Addams Family went off the air in 1966,network executives in charge of children's programming for NBC brought them back in 1973 for their own Saturday Morning cartoon show featuring the voices of Carolyn Jones,Jackie Coogan,and Ted Cassidy from the original series (minus John Astin who would return in the 1990's for a second animated version that was part of ABC's Saturday Morning schedule)which also ran for two seasons from 1973-1975.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "16 June 2004"}, {"title": " It's The 60's What's On TV ? The Addams Family", "content": "The Addams Family (1964-1966): Starring John Astin, Carolyn Jones, Jackie Coogan, Blossom Rock, Ted Cassidy, Ken Weatherwax, Lisa Loring, Felix Silla, Director Sidney Lanfield.<br/><br/>The Addams Family was a hit comedy sitcom, unlike anything TV viewers in the mid 60's had ever seen before, having been accustomed to seeing such wholesome family sitcoms like \"Leave It To Beaver\" \"Ozzie and Harriet\" or the more zany \"I Love Lucy\". TV shows were changing and this is the decade that would see such off-beat, creative shows as \"Gilligan's Island\", \"Bewitched\" and \"I Dream of Jeannie\". For three seasons from 1964 to 1966 on CBS, Americans were welcomed into the bizarre domestic life of the Addams family, whose members were loosely based on New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams' creations. John Astin portrayed Gomez, a wealthy lawyer who enjoys life, had eccentric tastes including yoga (at the time it was strange), playing with his trains and crashing them, Latin hour (he would dress in a toga and speak Latin, dueling, and his favorite- dancing with his hot wife. Gomez is a loving father, and, unlike other TV dads, displayed his sexual affections for his wife by kissing her up and down her arm whenever she spoke French to him. The beautiful Carolyn Jones, in a long, dragging black vampiric gown and long dark hair, portrayed his Gothic wife Morticia, who among other things, enjoyed sculpting, gardening or her idea of it(she would NOT cut the thorns),and ensuring that her two children Pugley and Wednesday live a creative and enriched life. Pugsley and Wednesday (Ken Weatherwas and Lisa Loring) were always looking to do mischief. Veteran actor Jackie Coogan (who had done silent films at one time) portrayed Uncle Fester, a Nosferatu-like bald man who was electrically charged (could light up a bulb by putting it in his mouth) and had a penchant for being tortured. Their butler was Frankenstein-like Lurch (Ted Cassidy) who answered the door, frightened away guests and could play beautiful harpsichord. The Addams lived in a world entirely of their own, but it was happy and they were functional and close-knit as a family. They always looked out for one another, and even Grandmama, the elderly witch (Blossom Rock) was revered and given due respect. Thing, the disembodied hand, helped with the mail and telephone and was \"handy\" to them. Often, the Addams' relatives dropped by, including the hairy Cousin Itt, Morticia's sister Ophelia and her mother (played by Wicked Witch of the West Margaret Hamilton)The music by Vic Mizzy was jazzy, upbeat and memorable. I can still hum many of the melodies. The jokes became repetitive after a while: The Addams did not fit in America in the 60's and were regarded as strange and even scary, but many times they were much better in character than the \"normal\" people. Their mansion was a large playground full of oddities. Gomez and Morticia were possibly the happiest married couple on TV, and were great together, especially when they did the tango. In 1966, the show experienced a decline in ratings but by then it had enjoyed a good run. It opened the doors to a new, innovative style of sitcom. Looking back, it was well-written and mostly a show better appreciated by adult and older audiences. It's a document in 60's television. Among some of the normal people included a parody of the Beatles, and there were even subtle references to swinging, free love, Morticia and Gomez enjoyed smoking from a hooka, and even a ton of 60's jazz, especially in the score by Vic Mizzy. One special guest star included the Robot from \"Forbidden Planet\" which everyone who had seen the movie at the time would have instantly recognized. The Addams had a rival family, another ghoulish clan- \"The Munsters\" who were on the rival network NBC, but both shows were actually being watched by the same demographic and both shows lasted the same amount of time, 3 seasons from '64 to '66.

You'll see: The fun refuses to concede defeat. Quite to the contrary. Welcome to \"Still Game\"!<br/><br/>Spun off from Ford Kiernan's and Greg Hemphil's sketch show \"Chewin' the Fat\", \"Still Game\" features strong 70+ characters ranging from the comedic widower duo Jack and Victor (Kiernan/Hemphil) over curmudgeon Winston, blabbermouth Isa and tight-arsed Tam to Indian-born shop owner Navid, who sports a rare talent for one-liners of the side-splitting kind. Now pleasures may be limited for old duffers, but life goes on and as such revolves around the local waterhole \"The Clansman\", the bookies, and the grocer's, with Isa's rumor mill working incessantly. Romance is a mere footnote. In that sense \"Still Game\" is not that far off the mark as real old geezers go. But in Craiglang there's a bright side to the shadow of old age: Death for example is a constant companion, accepted and dealt with in creative fashion (two words: hypothermia sweepstakes), and in the meantime as far as shaping the rest of one's life is concerned: disaster, small or large, is always around the corner. \"Still Game\", while out-and-out hilarious, occasionally dark-humored and sometimes over-the-top in a memorable way, also has its powerful dramatic moments.

This was the first time it had been shown nationwide and, thankfully, the unthinkable didn't happen. The slang. the swearing, the banter and the accents were all present and correct. You've got to hand it to the BBC for choosing not to tone down the dialect, if they'd been allowed to anglicise Still Game it just wouldn't be the same. I recently met the show's creators Ford Kiernon and Greg Hemphill at a book-signing and when they were quizzed over the possibility of Still Game being toned down, Kiernon replied, \"Naw, they can get it up them!\". Rapturous applause followed.<br/><br/>You wouldn't think this programme was now in its fourth series, it still feels as sharp and fresh as it did back in 2002. While most programmes, like Ford and Greg's own Chewin' The Fat for example, tend to go downhill after a couple of runs, Still Game seems to improve with each series. Admittedly most of the laughs consist of old people swearing at each other but the excellent cast deliver their put-downs with gusto. The two leads, Kiernon in particular, make very convincing pensioners; little touches like shuffling slightly and muttering under their breath work well.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are excellent as well. Jane McCarry, who plays \"nosey old cow\" Isa, sounds frighteningly like an old woman and her double act with Paul Riley's Winston is uproarious. Gavin Mitchell as Bobby the barman and Mark Cox as tight-fisted Tam are also excellent. But the absolute standout is Sanjeev Kohli as the acid-tongued shopkeeper Navid, Still Game's ultimate scene-stealer. Scottish dialect delivered in an Indian accent is funny in a way you've never heard and his horrific remarks to his wife Mena (whose face is always hidden) are comedy gold.<br/><br/>Along with being consistently hilarious, Still Game is occasionally very touching; Jack memories of his late wife and Victor's strained relationship with his son are bring a real pathos and humanity to the proceedings. These moments are quiet and understated, giving Still Game a maturity that Chewin' The Fat lacked.<br/><br/>Whether or not the folks down south got it or not is still unclear, some dreadful reviews would suggest not, but who gives a toss as Scotland once again has a sitcom it can really be proud of.

Like the earlier 'Rab C. Nesbitt', it originated from a sketch show which in this case was 'Chewin' The Fat'. Each week, the wily pensioners from Craiglang, played by Greg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan would show us how they fought to live another day.<br/><br/>The first sight of Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade was a curious sketch in which we see Victor drinking a glass of his own urine ( which he claims is all to do with his detox diet ), much to the bewilderment of Jack. The characters caught the public's attention so much that they were later spun-off into a stage show entitled 'Still Game'. Ford and Greg reprised their roles as Jack and Victor while Paul Riley was brought in as their friend Winston. The play saw the three men in Victor's living room, swapping various opinions, stories and memories in a bid to pass the time. 'Still Game' was a sell-out not only in Scotland, but also in England, Ireland and, surprisingly, Canada. Three years later it became a sitcom for BBC Scotland and within weeks established itself as unmissable Friday night viewing.<br/><br/>As you already know, Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade, along with their friends Winston, the tight-fisted Tam ( Mark Cox ) and incorrigible gossip Isa ( Jane McCarry ) are pensioners who refuse point blank to grow old gracefully. The three places in Craiglang they like to frequent most are the bookies, their local pub The Clansman which is run by the surly Boabby ( excellently played by Gavin Mitchell ) and the local newsagent, manned by the foul-mouthed Navid ( Sanjeev Kohli ) and his grumpy wife Meena ( who is only ever seen from behind ). Each episode would see Jack, Victor and co coping with whatever life threw at them, whether it was trying to survive against the cold weather or the local thugs making life hell for the residents of Craiglang. The reason for 'Still Game's' phenomenal success was because the public could identify with the characters. Each character has a grain of truth to them. For instance, who hasn't met someone as nosey as Isa in their time? As Jack and Victor, Ford and Greg are outstanding, though Paul Riley as Winston is undeniably the funniest. Also hilarious were Mark Cox and Sanjeev Kohli. Jake D'Arcy ( who sadly passed away not too long ago ) was funny in the episodes he appeared in as Pete the jakey. The late Ronnie Letham appeared from time to time as Isa's estranged husband Harry, as did Maureen Carr as Edith, a friend of Isa's who has teeth like a row of condemned houses and a voice that could grate cheese. Later in the series, Tam got married to local librarian Frances, who was portrayed by Kate Donnelly, who many people may remember from 'Naked Video'.<br/><br/>Among the impressive list of guest stars were Robbie Coltrane as a manic-depressive bus driver, Clive Russell as an old friend of Jack and Victor's, Celia Imrie as a surly home help, David Hayman as a food-van proprietor and life-long enemy of Winston but the best one of all was boxing champion Jim Watt, who appears at a charity event that Boabby is holding at The Clansman.<br/><br/>'Still Game' was initially only screened in Scotland by BBC1, but as the show began to rise in popularity, it eventually moved to BBC2 in 2005 for a national viewing ( with the earlier series broadcast nationally in reruns ).<br/><br/>In 2007, the show came off the air for a long time following a fall-out between Ford and Greg but in 2014 returned in triumph when it was revamped as a stage show ( shown at The SSE Hydro in Glasgow ). In October 2016, it returned with a seventh series. It had its fair share of moments but things weren't as good as before. Two more series followed, despite still overall being yet again somewhat patchy, things were tied up neatly in the final episode 'Over The Hill'.

DNA damage implies mutation, something that affects LIVING plants and animals. Is this guy trying to confuse the pilots? What the heck.\n*Similarly it doesn't follow at all that (alleged) gamma rays which kill living creatures would somehow destroy the non-living petrol. If the jet petrol has been so degraded that it will no longer combust, then you would expect all kinds of stuff to be disintegrating - ie plastics, etc. And why would the truck petrol be ok?\n* Why does Slyvie speak in French about throwing the soldiers off the flight when she doesn't know how much French the soldier speaks? She also uses easy words like Afghanistan, and criminelle. What the hell?\n* We know the story is taking place between September and March because they tell us that there will be more daylight in Hawaii. So it's in the colder months. Are they really walking around in Canada in the night without noticing the cold?\n* Why would this educated guy be completely unconcerned about a report that an animal (a ferret?) has survived the death rays? It appears that all life, plant, animal, food and even petrol is dead or dying. Surely anything stil alive is a vital clue?\n* If the passengers have internet connections, why aren't they using their spare time to research their situation? Surely there's someone alive somewhere to post on the internet (Arctic bases where it's continually dark in winter?). Even if there's no-one whatsoever alive, why aren't the passengers desperately looking into gamma rays, trying to find any information that might help them live? Instead they sit around fighting with each other.<br/><br/>However the really bad news is that there's nowhere near enough time to fly around the world at the lattitude of Brussels, have many adventures and yet stay in the dark the entire time. I added up all the passenger flight times and it came to 41 hours of flying time. For perspective the longest night of the year is 16hours in Brussels, so once around the world plus one night would be 24hours + 16 = 40hours.

The characters are larger than life in all the right ways. The writers hit the college comedy dead on in every episode. I skipped over this title in Netflix, but my husband decided to check it out one lazy afternoon. I knew I loved that man for a reason.<br/><br/>Darin Brooks makes debauchery delightful as Alex Moran, the second string quarterback for the Blue Mountain State Goats. His second string status allows slacker Alex to have high social status on campus while taking on very little responsibility. His dry humor and quick wit make him a hit with the ladies, but his womanizing ways don't alienate female viewers. His loyalty to long time best friend, socially awkward Sammy the mascot, lends some heart to this otherwise stereotypical man's man.<br/><br/>Alan Ritchman is consummate blonde and self-obsessed captain Thad Castle. Thad's only setting is full speed ahead. He is an overly confident idiot. The confidence with which he spouts his idiocy just serves to amplify the fact that the whole world is in on the joke except for Thad. He just blithely marches on with all the sincerity in the world, but not a clue as to the truth. His ignorance often leads Thad\u2014who I'm almost sure is straight\u2014to emit homo-erotic vibes that everyone perceives as weird and disturbing. Well, everyone except his sidekick and fellow defense man Larry, who picks up Thad's mixed signals loud and clear.<br/><br/>Fellow teammates include a kicker who is obsessed with drugs and likes the smell of his own genitals on his fingers; a white lineman whose halfro hairstyle and crazy actions make him look like a clown; and a narcissistic quarterback with his own hyperbaric chamber in his dorm room who required the goats to have a personal \"problem solver\" before he would agree to attend BMS. Somehow these characters manage to make up a championship football team.<br/><br/>The team is lead by Ed Marinaro as Coach Marty Daniels, a gruff \"who gives a crap\" alcoholic coach whose passion is football\u2014and needling his cougar ex-wife and her new husband, the intelligent but not all that smart Dean of Blue Mountain State. Daniels' nonchalance seems like the best way to handle his team and keep some grip on his sanity. As he watches the bizarre hazing and other off the wall antics of his team, the message his body language (and sometimes his mouth) portrays is usually a slightly bewildered, \"What the hell are they doing?\" <br/><br/>Full of college characters and college humor; don't expect much college level thinking from this show. It is one absurd half hour packed with stereotypes of college life that are so exaggerated that your jaw will inevitably drop\u2014either as you gasp for breath in laughter or as your mouth hangs agape in horror.

But, if you made a show that was truly realistic to what occurs in therapy, no one would watch it. So I feel the writers/producers of \"In Treatment\" made the smart move in focusing on the aspects of therapy (psychoanalysis, to be precise) that are most riveting; these tend to be issues of transference and counter-transference. The Friday supervisions/treatments that Paul receives provide vital clues to keep an eye out for in the subsequent sessions that he has in the following week. In the most recent episode (2-5-08), Paul is seen to be projecting onto Alex his own feelings towards his marriage by telling alex that he's probably known these marital concerns were at a \"boiling point\" for some time. This is a small example of the attention to detail that the writers/producers have paid to the realities of therapy; and if they did this without a psych consult, all the more credit to them.<br/><br/>Lets not forget that this is a television show. It can't be a perfect portrayal of the reality of the therapeutic environment. Lets ALSO remember that therapists are not perfect people. They can be idiots who foolishly leave medicine in their office bathroom cabinets; they can project their own issues into a session; and they can clog their toilets up, resulting in an argument with a client over boundaries (Laura, week2). Paul is being portrayed as an adept psychoanalyst with issues of self-worth that were probably never thoroughly analyzed during his training. When the narcissistic thrill of being a gifted therapist wears off, everything starts to make its way to the surface.<br/><br/>Kudos to HBO on a well-done series.", "rating": null, "helpful": "120 out of 129 found this helpful.", "date": "6 February 2008"}, {"title": " Has teeth and knows how to use them!", "content": "The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Rome ending, left a gaping hole in the heart of HBO for me. <br/><br/>I was ready to drop my subscription when I realized that Gabriel Byrne was going to be a key player in the new series, In Treatment. <br/><br/>WOW!

In Treatment has a unique format: Monday through Thursday, we focus on a different patient of therapist Paul (an interesting performance by Gabriel Byrne) and then on Friday, it's Paul himself who is in therapy (with the superb Dianne Wiest as Gina).<br/><br/>For the most part, the sessions are written in a realistic way, where the issues are revealed in layers, not upfront, which is how things generally are revealed in real life, so this works.<br/><br/>On Monday, we have Laura (the compelling Melissa George), who tells Paul she is in love with him. Yer basic \"transference\" as it's called, and Paul responds by telling her he's not an option. She's very persuasive, this Laura, and the next week (the second session we see), she comes back to tell him she's decided to accept her boyfriend Andrew's proposal of marriage, simply because Paul told her no. A lot of game-playing and power-tripping going on here, a lot of testing, as well, and then there's Paul's true feelings about the situation, which go far deeper than he shows Laura, of course.<br/><br/>Tuesday is Alex - he's a pilot who's flown bombing missions and is seeking help for his guilt, which he cannot even admit he has. He's the most controlling of the patients, constantly playing tedious ego games with Paul. <br/><br/>Wednesday, we've got Sophie, a teenage gymnast and Olympic hopeful who may or may not be subconsciously causing herself harm in order to get attention from her mother and/or to get out of the pressure of training. She also might be sexually involved with her coach - this is something I picked up on during the first session and I was pleased to see Paul bring it up with Gina in his own second session (which I watched last night). The actor who plays Sophie is Mia Wasikowska, and she is absolutely fantastic - she makes her lines sound as if she's creating them on the spot, a brilliant actor with a stunning career ahead of her. Her sessions are by far the most believable, and I find myself truly caring about what happens to her character.<br/><br/>Thursday we meet with a couple, Amy and Jake, who are having a baby and not sure if they want to keep this baby. The second of their sessions was cut short when Amy started having pains and they had to leave.<br/><br/>This provided a chance for Paul's wife Kate to have it out with him in his office, which she feels he uses to escape from her and shut her out. She's been very unhappy because she feels Paul puts all his energy into his work and has nothing left for her and their children - \"all I get is an anemic old tired man,\" she tells him. Then she proceeds to say she's been having an affair - something Paul already suspected and had mentioned to Gina in his first session with her. He then flies into a rage and demands details, so he won't be left to his own imagination, he tells her.<br/><br/>Friday, things really heat up, when Paul seeks solace by going to see Gina, a therapist with whom has an apparent history. By the second session, he's a wreck, although he was a mess the first week too, confiding in her that he feels he's been \"losing patience with my patients\" - which is true, from the behavior we had witnessed. <br/><br/>It's like the blind leading the blind, really, because Paul, we find, is egotistical, angry, deeply conflicted, confused and in denial just as much as the patients he attempts to treat. Even worse, he's withholding when it serves him. For instance, in their second session, he fails to tell Gina that HE was the one who demanded details of the affair from Kate, instead passing it off as if she was throwing these details in his face. It's only when Gina calls him on it that he sort of admits what really happened. <br/><br/>This is good though, the way Paul is portrayed - it makes him human. And the show is addictive, if you like this sort of thing, which I do, of course, even with the self-consciousness of some of the writing - only the sessions with Sophie genuinely ring true, as I've said. Rodrigo Garcia, who also worked on the other therapy show, Tell Me You Love Me, is a good writer and director, as are the others being employed, and I believe this show could blossom and go on for quite some time.<br/><br/>2/26/08: I've watched weeks 1-7 now, and I have to add: keep watching.

This season is much better, in every possible way: all the self-consciousness is gone from the writing, it's much more organic now and quite brilliant. Paul has new patients (all intriguing and beautifully written and brought to life in stunning performances across the board), and he's dealing with the fallout from Season 1 - most notably his infatuation with Laura which cost him his marriage and the potentially hugely damaging lawsuit brought on by Alex's father, who holds Paul responsible for his son's death. <br/><br/>In Week 5, we see a heart-breakingly sad Paul, whose father has just died.

In the world of television production, where the need to present program content in a hurry, and the rule of thumb that a hurried pace is a substitute for the development of characters, the medium is plagued with mediocrity as much as ever. Of course, many viewers prefer their telly fix with this subtext and the rule of hurry. Things have to be happening all the time, and expeditiously. <br/><br/>But this show resists these conventions brazenly: with exceptions in later episodes, each half-hour session is staged in the therapist's office, where each Monday Laura (Melissa George), for example, sits on a couch facing Dr. Weston and the two talk about her problems. This intimacy grows on the viewer and becomes very absorbing - maybe too absorbing to some. A viewer is frequently confronted with profound hardships and misery below the surface that he might not want to bother with \u0096 and more,that he might find too close to home to watch. And although there is plenty of intensity and fireworks, the pace is minimalist, using Bergmanesque silence and implication in ways that might prompt some viewers to reach for their remotes. <br/><br/>When these features of the program are combined with its dense time slotting, it runs the risk of being too much to ask of even the culturally high-ranked HBO viewer. One has to wonder if a second season might want to spread out the schedule, or somehow do one-hour shows.<br/><br/>HBO needs to bring it back in any case, because this is exceptional television. Through the intimacy of the single scene, clear channel dialog between the very able Byrne and his well-played patients, In Treatment moves, provokes, challenges, arouses \u0096 and entertains. The writing has its lapses, but they are few.<br/><br/>As his therapist (and teacher of years back), Wiest excels and her deeply ambivalent, often riveting exchanges with Byrne at their Friday evening sessions are finely wrought set pieces. Their time together is a well-designed vehicle for Byrne to let us know his story, the one he can't reveal during the rest of the week.<br/><br/>The ensemble of patients and his family \u0096 perhaps because of the commanding presence of Byrne to spur them \u0096 does well, including the sixteen year old Sophie and Byrne's wife, played by Michelle Forbes. Dr. and Mrs. Weston are unhappy \u0096 miserable is more accurate \u0096 and their row halfway through the show over her infidelity is a match for any excruciating confrontation in a work of an O'Neill or a Williams.<br/><br/>But by far the best of In Treatment is in Laura's sessions, and Melissa George informs her role with an energy and inventiveness that is both startling and marvelously disturbing. In a sense, the epicenter of the show is Laura, even when she's absent from an episode. In her raging passion for Paul, loosed in quanta among quieter but suspenseful moments of gazes and pleasantries, George's character takes confessions of impossible, painful love and turns them into potent star bursts. These are not exploding novas light years away, but launched across the table in the therapist's office, and rather than fading they refuse to cool, threatening to melt the covenant of therapist-patient. <br/><br/>These days television rarely has the privilege of portraying the kind of tension one witnesses between Byrne and George. His efforts to impose his distance as therapist from her (and his) tormented erotic impulses are matched by her doggedness, however tainted it is by the maladjustment that brought her to him in the first place. In a sense Laura makes her therapist captive, deftly blurring the hallowed ethical line separating them. <br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, beyond her casting in unremarkable pictures like Amityville Horror and other television work like Alias, Melissa George dived into the big waves of HBO. Beauty counts for much on television and in the movies, but at some point one has to turn action into character, and George has figured it out. And then some.

My first quibble, though I loved the show, is what straight woman or gay man could possibly have Gabriel Byrne as their psychiatrist?

The same horror loving, cheese flaunting, camera angle loving, wire fu abusing, low budget utilizing, Bruce Campbell toting, Ted Raimi killing, Spiderman trilogy directing machine? Yes.<br/><br/>I have to admit, when I first saw this show I thought it was one of the worst shows I had ever seen. It was always on right before the show I would want to see and I would catch glimpses of the cheesy graphics, strange camera angles, insane dialogue, etc. and would laugh at how bad it was. However, the moment I discovered that Sam Raimi produced the show, it was an instant \"OOOOH, so the show is SUPPOSED to be that way!\" and I gave it a chance. The more I watched the show, the more I realized how amazing the show was. While the cheesy graphics were a result of the times and budget (keep in mind, though, that the same company who did the graphics in the show would go on to produce the award winning graphics for Lord of the Rings), Sam Raimi uses his trademark skills to make this show thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>The intentionally over-acted, pun-ridden dialogue, extensively choreographed action scenes, fun costumes, and crazy myth-based story lines make this show a delight, but I think it's the visible enjoyment of the main cast that makes this show really great. Everybody, from the reoccurring characters to the show's main stars are obviously having the time of their lives enjoying every single line and action sequence. It helps that the producers allowed the actors to adlib a lot of the dialogue and physical gags.<br/><br/>As for the show's cast, I couldn't imagine anyone better to play Hercules than 90's Television's straight lead man, Kevin Sorbo. Sure, he oftentimes just stands there with clothes that conveniently reveal his always sweaty muscular chest, but he fit the role to a T. He did a great job playing the almost sickeningly perfect half-mortal Hercules (something they joke about continuously in the series) and obviously enjoyed himself in the fight scenes. Other notable mentions include Bruce Campbell (of course) whose smarmy portrayal of the King of Thieves is priceless (he even directed a number of the best episodes of the show), Kevin Smith (no, not THAT Kevin Smith) who was priceless as Ares, God of War, reveling in over-the-top testosterone and much improvised humor, and Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, God of Love, who played the part of a ditsy blonde perfectly.<br/><br/>However, probably THE most talented actor in the Hercules/Xena troupe was Michael Hurst, who portrayed Hercules short and peppy sidekick, Iolaus. In order to be noticed or successful as an actor here IN New Zealand, theater is still the primary form of entertainment. Well before Hercules, Hurst was already a renown New Zealand Shakespearean theater actor, director, producer, dancer, and singer, in addition to a championship fencer and acrobatic stage-fight choreographer. If I could choose anyone to compare this guy to, it'd be Britain's thespian Kenneth Branagh...if he could do gymnastics and was on speed. His energetic talent was so well known in the country that he was literally the first person to be cast in Hercules (BEFORE even Kevin Sorbo got the part as the lead). He stole the show with this energetic and over-the-top acting style for Iolaus and choreographed/performed most of the Hercules/Iolaus fight scenes and stunts. While he never really got a chance to exhibit his true acting prowress due to the light nature of the show, he came close with versatility. Presumably bored with his role, Raimi and the producers found every excuse in the book to allow Hurst to exercise his acting - by the time Hercules ended, he had played about 12 different characters in addition to Iolaus ranging anywhere from a drunken writer to a reoccurring woman dance instructor. There's no question that this show wouldn't have been as successful if Michael Hurst hadn't contributed his talent. I've always been kind of upset that Hurst will never be recognized outside our country (beyond \"that short hyper blonde guy from Hercules\") due to his extensive involvement with New Zealand theater - this guy could have easily gone on to do Broadway in the States or the Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain. However, I'm pleased to hear he still works on Sam Raimi projects when not doing plays, directing episodes for Legend of the Seeker and, more recently, Spartacus - both of which we get down here, yay! So, in sum, Sam Raimi is insane but incredibly brilliant for producing this show. I highly recommend it for those of you that \"get\" Raimi's unique direction or if you have any sense of humor whatsoever. It's extremely addictive. Do NOT take it seriously, or you will be disappointed - it's supposed to be campy. If you are a fan of anything Sam Raimi, entertaining fight sequences, Kevin Sorbo or Michael Hurst (if you happen to be from New Zealand), or enjoy watching actors have WAY too much fun for their own good, then this is a show for you.", "rating": null, "helpful": "14 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "17 February 2012"}, {"title": " I Loved This Show the way Woody Allen \"Loufed\" Annie Hall", "content": "I was excited when I saw that Kevin Sorbo was to be in a Series based on his \"Hercules\" character which had been the subject of several of those Universal \"Action Pack\" TV-Moovies. I loufed those too, I totally dug that Heracle's Dad was Anthony Quinn. And his wife was Tawny Kitaen.<br/><br/>But the Weekly Series could not include Quinn as Zeus, and they killed off Tawny Kitaen as Heracle's original wife Deianeira - Who according to the actual Myth of Hercules was killed by being sopped in a poison cloak by a Centaur... So Zeus, as he could change form often, could use several different actors to play him, and they did bring back Deianeira in several episodes where Hercules visited her in The Elysian Fields.<br/><br/>I set aside \"Hercules Time\" for myself each week - As this show was syndicated, at first that was difficult because they moved the show around a little bit at first. Eventually, they showed it at relatively the same time on relatively the same channel each week, so I was able to eventually build a continuity for watching this show.<br/><br/>And as the show itself ran, it built internal continuities for itself - And for Michael Hurst, Heracle's \"Side Kick\" Iaolus - And his Dad \"Zeus\" (Eventually played by Roy Dotrice for several Episodes)- and stepmother always in his \"Hera\" sometimes played by Meg Foster - And his Brother Iphicles, and Even later visits by Xena and Ares and Strife. And Sorbo's wife \"The Golden Hind\" (Played by Sorbo's Wife Sam Jenkins - They met while filming the Golden Hind Ep and got married, always thought that was cool)-I had a comfort with these characters.<br/><br/>The Locations, all in New Zealand, were majestic - Whenever there was some Fort or Castle or Village, I was always convinced of Antiquity. Which was amazing considering the sheer amount of deliberate anachronisms they used to use as gags in the episodes - Especially with Robert Trevor's \"Used Toga Salesman\" character Salmoneus. I just think about this stuff, and have to giggle, I was amused and entertained by this show for several long years.<br/><br/>Sorbo not only took us through Ancient Greece as if it were a walk through our own neighborhoods, but later in the series especially the last season, he actually visited several other Mythological Milieus - Asengard, Ireland, England, there were even visits by Angels from Christian Mythos. So Hercules basically visited not only all of the Grecian places that may have been associated with him, but also places in other Myths from other cultures.<br/><br/>Of course, \"historically\" none of this was ever meant to be \"accurate\" - It was just meant to be fun.

And producer Robert Tapert as well. From the moment these episodes started playing, until the end credits and the \"Renniassance\" logo - Suspiciously similar to Mel Gibson's \"Icon\" Logo- rolled, this series entranced and enthralled me for all the years it played.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "25 out of 27 found this helpful.", "date": "15 April 2012"}, {"title": " Seen in a new light", "content": "I watched this show along with Xena when I was a kid and I was always a bigger fan of Xena but watching the reruns now I have come to appreciate Hercules in whole new light.

Also I love it's sheer positivity. Today in most media our heroes are so jaded and as much as that darkness and complexity is fascinating it is a little demoralizing. Sorbo's Hercules in today's media is almost a breath of fresh air as a character who despite his own tragedies and what he has seen still believes in good and goes out of his ways to not compromise his values.<br/><br/>On a note about mythological accuracy. Most Greek Myths have alternate versions as it is so what would constitute an accurate portrayal? Not to mention that many Greek myths mirror Mesopotamia myths which in turn were practically rewritten by the Romans just replacing Greek names with Roman ones.

Being a swede, the show that really stood out as another fine mess was the one with the Norse gods. Some enlightenment: The viking-age took place some 2000 years after Hercules had died. Odin is one-eyed, and he meets his end in Ragnarok. Thor's hammer (Mjollnir) has a shortened shaft due to Loki's interference. Loki is described as a dark-haired, beautiful man (with a devious mind). But since this is a fantasy - who cares ? The acting is mostly fine, with Iolaus as the most complex character of the two, giving the show some depth. And there are some great characters coming and going, such as the self-absorbed thief Autolocus, the money-loving Salmoneus, and Falafel the chef, for comic relief. The women portrayed are for the most part strong and independent, with a will and resourcefulness to match the men, especially Echidna, Aphrodite, and the no nonsense Amazon warriors. Its a pity though that they didn't put Athena in the script, since she is the embodiment of female ingenuity and power - it would have been fun to watch the ongoing feud between her and Ares, but as it is, Xena is a worthy successor to the part.

Everything on TV now is a sad depiction of reality which we see everyday in our lives, and that's not what entertainment means to me. If you truly want to have fun, relax, and escape from daily pressures of life: watch Hercules LJ. That is not to say it's completely unrealistic, the characters are very much believable, except for some of the stunts they manage to pull off of course, and they are quiet comparable. The show is not 100% true to Greek Mythology, and it really works out well since something like that can't truly make it pass one season if true to the source material.<br/><br/>The show's heart and soul is of course Hercules himself, played by charming and all around nice guy, Kevin Sorbo. He really brings a lot of his own sweet personality to Hercules and makes him unique and believable in a sense that he is human (partly if you will). Also, this is by far the best depiction of Hercules, he is smarter and able to thoroughly assess the given situation. Than, there is Ioalus (did I spell that right?) Hercules' partner, the very human component of the show if Hercules wasn't enough for the audience. He brings to surface many issues which a normal human would face, of course they are conveyed in accordance with the theme of the series. Besides those two, there are other characters which truly illuminate the humorous side of the series such as Autolycus (King Of Thieves) and Salmoneus (A true Business man). Ares (god of war played by Kevin Smith) too would fit into that category of comedic characters but time to time there would be serious confrontations between him and Hercules.<br/><br/>The show had a really good start but there were moments that showed the series was doing poorly, such as the third season. But things started to look better in Season 5, which re-introduced some of the darker themes that made Hercules fun. My personal theory is that it's producers fault after Xena was born. Although Xena was a success for a spin-off character who got her own series, it is partly for blame for Hercules' downfall in my opinion. The quality took a major turn soon after Xena began, possible reason: Rob and Lucy's relationship. Of course if people involved with the series get into relationships, things start to favor those people regardless of intentions. So it might be that the producer Rob Tapert might have put a lot of effort into the series featuring Lucy Lawless, while Hercules got the lesser treatment. That's just me though, because there is no other explanation. If same people are involved in both series, how can one be worse than the other? Why not put same amount of effort into both? And the answer to that is what I said before, when cast and crew get into a relationship things might take a more favorable turn.<br/><br/>No offense to Xena fans but that's more plausible explanation than just that Hercules was a lesser show for no reason at all. But that doesn't mean I hate the character of Xena, except for her battle cry, she has always proved to be trustworthy ally for Hercules and her episodes within Hercules' series are always top-notch. And I personally think Xena is better female hero than Wonder-Woman.<br/><br/>The music by Lo Duca is truly epic, I can never get enough of the title theme. All in all, a great series.

More than not, Xena gets into a big fight, worries about Gabriel, and espouses some platitudes about giving up fighting and finding her true path through life.  Hercules has been very inventive about killing off loved characters and exposing a mostly lay audience to different myths.  While his solutions to most dramatic situations seem trite from time to time, it is important to keep one thing in mind:  the show is camp and it doesn't have any pretentions about being something it's not.

Lots of slapstick. Muscle bound Kevin Sorbo did a decent job of playing Hercules. Tho, he was mostly wooden in his acting. He was surrounded by great actors, Michael Hurst, Robert Trebor, Bruce Campbell, Kevin Smith, Alexander Tydings, just to name a few. Michael Hurst in particular brought a lot of fun and humour to the show. <br/><br/>Mostly different writers/producers from Xena, quantitative-wise. Xena never took away anything from it. If anything it added to it as a companion show. The complaints to this are usually from a few fans of a certain actor, and by this actor himself as an excuse to explain why Hercules wasn't more popular than Xena. As though saying: \"There must be a reason. It can't be that Xena was simply liked better by more people.\" The ego can't handle that thought I suppose. The irony being that they are the ones that point out that Xena was better then Hercules more then anyone else. Always whining that Hercules was a \"lesser\" show because \"Xena took away.\" <br/><br/>A half empty glass.........<br/><br/>Propping by dissing never works. <br/><br/>The two shows were very very different even though both take place in the mythological genre. While both may have common fans, it's only logical that each would also appeal to different masses of fans. One was simply going to do better. It only makes sense. There's no way these shows would perform equally. Look at the CSI's for example, they all have different respective ratings. Not equal performance.<br/><br/>I might add that Lucy Lawless was a huge factor. There is just something about her. Something special. Furthermore, where there have been countless male heroes on the screen there have been relatively very few female heroes. Thus adding a curiosity factor, an uniqueness, and just plain awesomeness of it all, which helped propel Xena to cult status. Not to mention that Xena is an absolutely wonderful show that has captured the hearts and imaginations of many.<br/><br/>Got off track. Sorry. Needless to say, I for one prefer my glass half full. I enjoyed watching this show. Although I found the Hercules character too good to be true. Mr Perfect! Not much depth where he was concerned. He was always right. He never made mistakes. Personally, I prefer shades of grey in my heroes. The stories were too simple. There were never any complex nor thought-provoking stories.

The offbeat acting, the sly humor, and the gorgeous scenery all played well as a backdrop to the Americanized (some say bastardized) version of the Hercules myths.<br/><br/>Seasons 1 through 3 are fantastic. Seasons 4-6 steadily lost the flair that the previous seasons exuded, but they are not without charm. Friday nights at 8pm was the prime watching hour for Herc; unfortunately, the show lost this time slot and was delegated to mid-afternoon on Saturdays. It is readily apparent that the show's writers/producers knew that Hercules was destined to end and you can really see that with seasons 5 and 6. They introduce many more 'goofy' themes (the Nordic myths, the Irish druid myths, King Arthur, the odd \"modern\" episodes) in these seasons. It was around this time that Xena also got a bit odd with Xena killing the Gods and whatnot (and a sudden leap into the future with Gabrielle). But, for my money, you can't beat the Herc/Xena combo from 1995-1997/1998 (or so).", "rating": null, "helpful": "6 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "3 January 2005"}, {"title": " impressive", "content": "This is a pretty good show. Of course, I am a little prejudiced towards it, since Hercules was my boyhood hero. It is good, plenty of action and special effects, though sometimes a few episodes became somewhat childish. The acting is good all around, especially Kevin Sorbo, though he makes Hercules look more of a boy scout than he really was according to the myths.<br/><br/>I only have two other complaints. The first is the writers give Hera waaaaaaaaaaaaaay to much power. I mean, I know she was queen of the gods, but she goes off and does all these things, conjuring and creating all these monsters constantly and doing other things. For example in one episode she turned Nemesis (the demigod the gods would send to execute their retribution) into a mortal. What? She can just do that without any consent from the other Olympians? Come on.<br/><br/>My other complaint is making Zeus look like a coward and a wimp. Good grief, they make it look like he's incapable of reigning in the other Olympians. He was their king, they all answered to him. In the myths, when Hercules needed help, Zeus would either give it himself or send another god to do so. But in the series he's reluctant to help Hercules, lest he anger the other gods. Hello, people? When Hera tried to usurp Zeus, he broke free and bound her with golden chains, held her up over a cliff, her in one hand and a thunderbolt in the other, ready to send her down to Tartarus. But in the series, Zeus makes Hercules a god because he can't face Hera alone. Ugh.<br/><br/>That's all the bad stuff. The rest of the series is good. Personally my favorite episodes are the ones where the late Kevin Smith guess stars as Ares, a role he fills quite well. It's also an interesting rivalry, I'm glad the writers thought of it. Hercules is the illegitimate son of Zeus, but he's a great hero, while Ares is the legitimate son of Zeus, but he's a scheming, treacherous warmonger. Ironic, no?<br/><br/>Anyway, overall it's good.

The season premiere was a 2-parter that not only brought back Chelsea, but the following episode dealt with her being gone for so long and not raising her kid. Then, in episode 7 we finally meet Levi's dad! Tess is also back in every episode and contributing to the story, and that obnoxious child landlord seems to be MIA thank the lord. I still wish we'd see Ravens mom and know if she ever graduated law school, and Cory really needs to appear and spend some time with his niece and nephew. But I commend the writers for really stepping it up last season, and I'm actually looking forward to season 4 now. I've already seen the crossover with Bunk'd, which I had mixed feelings about (that has more to do with my hatred for the latter show), but overall the writing and acting is on par with season one and sometimes even better. I do miss the callbacks to the old show, but I understand this is for today's generation as well so I digress. But they're also strengthening Raven and Chelsea's friendship and as an OG fan, that's all I can really ask.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: 5/10\nSeason one was so great, Raven and Chelsea were just as you remembered them, and there were enough throwbacks to That's So Raven to satisfy fans, plus their kids were good too. Season 2 was off to a good start, with Raven and Booker telling each about their psychic abilities, and the 3 parter with Dr Sleevemore was interesting and the musical episode was well done. The Halloween episode was also great fun, but for the most part season 2 has just been a huge let down. They brought back her dad, and he did literally nothing. Had no funny lines. They didn't even bring up her mom or brother. After all these years I'd rather they at least kill her off screen rather than continue to wipe her from existence like we're just supposed to forget about her. And Chelsea has been missing in more than half the episodes, and they didn't give an explanation until she'd been missing for a few episodes already and now it doesn't look like she's gonna be in the rest of the season. There were some Levi-centric episodes that his mom really should've been present in. Also Booker and Nia were 11 last season but now they're 13? Tess has also been suspiciously missing in a good chunk of the episodes, and when she does appear she hardly does anything. And their landlord being an obnoxious child is fine for a sitcom geared towards children, but the actor is awful and his character has no redeeming qualities. Thankfully he too has been mostly absent in the second half of the season. But that begs the question why are so many characters being put on the back burner? And what the hell does Raven do, is she a fashion designer, a Sc\u00fct driver, or a painter? They just really dropped the ball this season and I've been letting episodes build up in the DVR rather than looking forward to it every week. I would like to know where Raven's mom is, id like to know if Cory in the House is considered canon, and maybe it's time we meet Levi's dad? For a revival of a show that didn't get a proper ending the first time round, this sequel series has been very disappointing.

It's okay, though. I enjoy Raven and Chelsea's still-strong chemistry and for the most part the kids carry their own storylines well. They also tackle some more serious topics than recent Disney shows so I appreciate that.<br/><br/>The problem is...it's Disney. In recent years, Disney has not tackled serious topics well. They try, but it comes off too preachy or the episodes are watered down to keep them \"kid friendly.\" Disney used to handle more serious storylines in a tame enough way, but they long ago lost the ability to do it naturally. That's what happens with this show. The serious moments are too contrived or are not serious enough (an example being the episode where Levi's dad/Chelsea's ex comes back after being in prison for THREE YEARS. I understand needing to keep the content light, but it was way TOO light considering the circumstances in my opinion).<br/><br/>Another issue I have with this series is Raven and Chelsea as adults. I still enjoy their friendship, but individually I'm not keen on either character anymore. I feel as though Raven is not really a nice person in this series...? I'm not quite sure how to explain it. And Chelsea is just over-the-top dumb. This show doesn't escape the \"kids are smarter than the parents\" theme that his plagued Disney for so long, and I had hopes that it might. But no, the kids tend to act like parents and the parents like kids. A lot of scenes show Booker and Nia talking down to, lecturing, or lying to Raven and she's portrayed as ridiculous or oblivious. And Levi being smarter than Chelsea and treating her like a kid is a running theme and supposed to be played for comedic effect. Really? I'm 20 years old and I'm not even speaking from a parental standpoint here--I'm just tired of every TV show having overly-clueless parents.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this show 5 stars. I have enjoyed some episodes and there are a lot of cute moments and a few serious moments that are done well.

And of course, I'm always a supporter of Latino shows and movies.  When people think of minorities being snubbed from the media, they immediately think \"blacks,\" but I would argue that we need to see a lot more Latinos on TV and in the movies.  And just like \"The Cosby Show\" didn't play out stereotypes of an African-American family, \"George Lopez\" doesn't play out stereotypes of a Latino-American family. The characters are universal, and could be played by actors of any race.  I don't know why it is, and I'm definitely not complaining, but it seems like they always cast a real hottie to play the wives on these sitcoms.  In \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" there's Patricia Heaton, in \"King of Queens\" there's Leah Remini, and the actress who plays Lopez's wife is also a hottie!

'Lopez' falls somewhere between the crude, edge of 'Carey' and the standard family sitcom. But the scripts are consistently a triumph of avoiding standard sitcom clich\u00e9s, instead the show has turned toward a comedic spin on domestic drama where George Lopez (obviously as himself) struggles though (sometimes cataclysmic) events in his work and family life all the while trying to make sense of his family's past and his maniacal, brazenly without shame mother Benny (Belita Moreno). Season 3 (I could take or leave seasons 1 and 2), was ripe with domestic confrontations, family secrets revealed and a long lost father and siblings for George. In more than one way the tone of the show recalls you might get if you burned away all the rawest, sharpest edges from Fox's 'Titus'.<br/><br/>George Lopez shines in the show. The biggest crack in the armor is in the supporting cast. Where 'Titus' had a strong one in the legendary Stacy Keach and Cynthia Watros, Moreno doesn't have the presence of a chief antagonist and often just comes off obnoxious - so much so it will prompt me to change the channel during her scenes. Constance Marie is stuck in a largely thankless role as Lopez's wife, much of the time just staying out of Lopez's way. The show hasn't put her in the typical whiny sitcom mom role which is appreciated more than anything she does, but when the story requires Marie is able to step up in a way that the rest of the cast can't. Really, that only marginally matters, because it's quite literally all Lopez's show. George Lopez tears through the sharp dialog like a Tasmanian devil, spitting it all out with an impeccable comic delivery able to get big laughs from little lines like \"Stitch it on a pillow sister, we need cash\". He is the tent pole that almost all the laughs swing around and the show is at it's best when it knows that - allowing for the supporting cast, in all their limited acting ability, to stand as plot-device in Lopez's way.<br/><br/>'George Lopez' is the first mainstream, successful American sitcom with an almost all Hispanic cast. It sprinkles touches of cultural authenticity all around - and in ways I'm sure I don't get, but for the most part the family is largely mainstream. I can understand that some might view is a copping out. I see it more as the show's desire to present a traditional sitcom family that happens to be Mexican. Now, if there were a lot more shows on TV like this, then we might have an issue. <br/><br/>One of my favorite bits in the series is the way it brought back the time-tested tradition of a conservative father debating with his liberal daughter (Masiela Lusha). Season 3 opened with a bang in the hour-long episode \"Dad, Dubya and Dating\" where Lopez tries to keep daughter Carmen from joining an anti-war protest. In a later episode, in a funny spin on preachy series, Carmen says her rights have been violated by \"the New England Patriots Act\", to which George replies \"That's about gay marriage, don't you pick up a newspaper\". We get the sense that 'George Lopez' doesn't want to be seen as a pioneer sitcom, nor does it want to make a political statement. It just wants to be funny - and it is that. It's also substantive and genuine which is rare.

At least in the show, there are elements of other aspects to life rather than just animosity towards white people.<br/><br/>The show is good because it is realistic to many situations. George is a self-made factory manager, who married a loving but sometimes neurotic wife, Angie, has a troubled and quite spoilt daughter, Carmen, and a gullible, somewhat spoilt younger son, Max.

It also has its comedic moments.<br/><br/>I understand the pain of Mexicans. I am not white, but like I said, I have seen his stand up. Three hours of his rambling hatred towards Caucasians made me quite nauseas. Doesn't this guy ever give up? What does he know about immigration patterns, anyway? He was born in America, and maybe his childhood was abusive (I'm switching back to the show, though it's true in real life) he turned out okay. I am half-Arab, and my people have been denied immigration because of 9/11. He acts as if Latinos are the only ones that undergo racism. Arabs are defined as terrorist because of a few group of renegades who are insane.<br/><br/>Sorry about the political situation.

While I was not gripped or binge watching as I would some others, I still watched an episode a night and for the most part enjoyed the show. The cast is diverse and for the most part good actors. I liked all of the storylines especially the global scale to them.<br/><br/>The problems:\n* This one was a big one for me, but most likely a non-issue for others: the Russian. I am a native Russian speaker and while most of the Russian cast speaks good fluent Russian, some of the main characters clearly don't speak a word and are just trying to pronounce words phonetically. Additionally the subtitles for the Russian characters are often very poorly done, while they convey the meaning of what is being said, they rarely/never match the actual words, phrases, or style used. A character might be speaking very familiarly and casually while the subtitles will be bland and formal and visa versa.<br/><br/>* Suspension of disbelief. A lot of the characters, which we are supposed to believe are quite smart, will make absolutely moronic decisions and miss very obvious things. Many, many more cases that I can not list without spoiling events.<br/><br/>* The main character. The main character is referred to as \"the only honest banker\" and yet from the first episode he has no problem telling lies to his loved ones and has no problem with crimes or violence committed in his name. When I started the show I thought it was supposed to be about how an honest man slowly descends into crime, this was not the feeling I had after watching it.<br/><br/>* The pacing. Some stuff happens way too slowly and some way too fast. While sometimes this is used for dramatic effect, it often seems unintentional, almost an oversight. Some storylines feel rushed and others too drawn out.<br/><br/>* The lead actor. While most of the cast is pretty good, nothing about the main actor is. He seems incapable of displaying emotion and speaks in a very boring manner. Thinking back, I can not remember a single time when I said to my self \"wow James Norton is nailing this scene.\"<br/><br/>Despite all these complaints I still watched all of it, and rarely did I feel uninterested.

There is a good sense of danger; this increases as the story progresses and there are a few shocking moments. James Norton does an impressive job as Alex. The rest of cast does a fine job too; not so long ago one would expect British actors putting on accents to depict the Russians, Israelis and other nationalities but here local actors are used and if the character isn't meant to be talking English then they speak their own language with subtitles; to my mind this is a distinct improvement.

David simply had no understanding of how the world worked because his parents had no idea. This is why the writers were using his boss for those moments of wisdom. Ultimately it was those scenes is what the show was really about. Understanding how you get to where you want to go, and not just be some sap like all these characters represented, destined for disillusionment.<br/><br/>Great acting, characters were played out well enough to understand and feel for them, but it did lack a sense of progression. Even if you have characters who suffer a static life, the story needs progression, and I think the writers ran out of gas.<br/><br/>David is Ferris Bueller with a job.

Every episode in the series is barely 22 mins long. While the first season dealt with the lead character - David Myers's (Craig Roberts) stint as a tennis coach for a summer in Red Oaks club. The second season spoke about the subsequent summer at the club. The season ended with David breaking up with his gf Skye &amp; Skye's father losing his court battle.\n The third season does not see David back to teaching tennis at the club. David is working in the city for ad film company. There is a new woman in David's life in the third season. His parents have moved on &amp; are both seen to be exploring romantic opportunities with others. David's mother - Judy Myers (Jennifer Grey) is doing well as a real estate broker, whereas his father - Sam Myers (Richard Kind) has found a way to monetize his love for food. Sam has finally found love in a woman. Doug Getty (Paul Reiser) is in a minimum security prison for the rich. His daughter Skye (Alexandra Socha) does make an appearance in this season as well. A lot of time is devoted to Wheeler's (Oliver cooper) &amp; Misty's (Alexandra Turshen) relationship. Nash(Ennis Esmer) - easily the most popular character on the show, has quite a few ups &amp; down in the third season. He is not quite himself. He is not seen making sexist comments or flirt with women in this season. \nWith a run time of barely 22 mins, you end up wanting more. Every episode is entertaining &amp; easy on your senses. Every character is well defined. Everybody in the cast does a good job. With Nash &amp; wheeler becoming subdued versions of themselves, Doug has the best lines this season. \nThe ending does leave a lot to be desired. Despite the makers having made it clear that they won't be returning for a fourth season, there are several loose ends at the end of the show. Fans of the show will not get the closure they will have hoped for. \nFor those who are yet to see a single episode of this series, we highly recommend this series.

David's at that point in life where he isn't sure what he wants to do. His father wants to him to follow in his footsteps and become a CPA while David wants to learn film.

Getty is an absolute arrogant prick who is used to getting his way and couldn't care less what the others may think of him. He's a poor kid who worked his way to the top and needless to say he's not thrilled with the prospect of his daughter ending up with an assistant tennis pro.<br/><br/>As in any series, some episodes are terrific, others are clunkers.

Somehow we don't hear about the Spanish. It is on a different level, granted, but as a former actress, I can state as this is my third Spanish series, that Spanish acting is wonderful.<br/><br/>Velvet is the story of a department store family in 1950s Madrid; after the patriarch and owner of the store kills himself, his son Alberto (Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre) returns from London to take over the family business. He rekindles his childhood romance with Ana Ribero (Paula Echevarr\u00eda) who lived at the store with her uncle after the death of her mother. The two plan to marry. <br/><br/>The store, however, is in bad financial shape, and an offer of cash comes with the strong suggestion that Alberto marry the financier's daughter Cristina (Manuela Velasco). Though it breaks her heart, Anna encourages him to do it, and he does. Ana and Alberto remain in love and still want to be together.<br/><br/>Later Alberto butts heads with Cristina's brother Enrique (Diego Martin) as the two fight for management of the store. <br/><br/>\"Velvet\" is soapy, but the reality the actors bring to the series make it seem less so. The characters are beautifully drawn. The women in the sewing room, of whom Ana is one, are outstanding, especially Manuela Vell\u00e9s (Luisa) and Cecilia Freire (Rita). <br/><br/>For me, it is Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre as Alberto who makes the show, and he is what Spanish acting is all about - natural, relaxed, charming, and intense, he is perfect as a man who adored his father and takes his responsibilities to Velvet seriously. From smiling at customers in the elevator to laughing at his best friend's (Javier Rey) crazy love problems, to exploding at his wife, he is amazing. <br/><br/>His chemistry with Paula Echevarr\u00eda is wonderful, and you can believe the two have a long history together. Echevarria brings warmth to her role as the self-sacrificing Ana, and we can see her development as a person during the series. These two are much stronger actors than the romantic stars of Gran Hotel, though their material is better.<br/><br/>And one of those Gran Hotel stars, the gorgeous Amaia Salamanca, has a large role as Barbara, Cristina's sister-in-law. I honestly didn't recognize her as she wears a brunette wig, and her acting is so different. She plays a jaded, somewhat bitter woman whose husband cheats on her. In Gran Hotel, she was this fragile, soft woman -- quite a change.<br/><br/>Another Gran Hotel star, Lloren\u00e7 Gonz\u00e1lez, plays Jonas, an opposite role from Andres in Gran Hotel. Here he's a gum chewing smart aleck, kind of a snake oil salesman type, whereas as Andres, he was sad and victimized for much of the series.<br/><br/>The only thing in the show that drove me insane was the romance between Rita and Pedro (Adrian Lastra) which was too drawn out and frustrating. Both actors though demonstrated a wide range of comedy and drama. Also when one watches it as I did, binge watching, it seems like everybody is constantly being slapped in the face.<br/><br/>There are too many excellent actors to single out because everyone is so good, but kudos to Jose Sacristan as Ana's uncle; Asier Etxeandia as the designer Raul; Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n as the manager of the sewing room, Dona Blanca; Angela Molina as the tragic Isabel; and Marta Hazas as Rita's sexy knockout sister, Clara. <br/><br/>The '50s music is great, a lot of sha-na-na songs, love songs, and Elvis-type music. Someone on this board stated that this series was probably made for American audiences, because some colloquialisms and fashion (mainly pajamas) don't seem right, and there is no mention of Franco, no sevillanas, no bullfights. It was perhaps watered down a bit to appeal to foreigners, though they have done an excellent job of recreating the '50s.

As a great lover of Madrid, who knows intimately well the Gran Via area, it is fun to see the building housing Galerias Velvet (now the Hotel Tryp Cibeles and Zara store) with the landmark Carrion building in the background.<br/><br/>The series is well written, recreates brilliantly the Madrid of yesteryear, the supporting roles are well described, and the acting is quite good. Jos\u00e9 Sancristan is brilliant, and Aitana Sanchez Gijon is excellent. The chemistry between Ana and Alberto (I don't know why some reviewers here call him \"Roberto\") works very well and sounds even more genuine when you know that they were a couple in real life. <br/><br/>The show, though, still leaves an overall feeling of being written for foreigners, mainly Americans, as it comes across as not very authentic. Some of the expressions I heard in a recent episode (For example \"Eso es el espiritu\" in Episode 14) I had never heard in Spanish and seem translated straight from English. The employees all dress in pyjamas and wear robes which for some reason I cannot associate with 1960s' working class Madrilians. Sure, the series makes a good effort at recreating cars, cocktails and clothing (the latter is hardly surprising in a show about fashion) from that time, but it never mentions the political/cultural/social circumstances of the times (Franco's name is never heard, something impossible for anybody living in Spain in the 1950s/60s.) \"Mad men\" did a much better job in that respect - and in a similar decade.<br/><br/>When Ana and her friends go out dancing, it's rock and roll and cha cha cha, which is fine, but what about sevillanas? Until late 1990s young Spaniards would always engage in flamenco dancing. You never see that in Galerias Velvet, as if it were a foreign concept. What about bullfights? That was a central part of an outing in Spain then, but you never hear or see a single character going to a \"corrida\" or mentioning somebody going there. <br/><br/>Some of the coincidences, which I will not mention here to avoid spoilers, are a bit far-fetched and would stretch your sense of (in)credulity. To mention \"Mad men\" again, \"Galerias velevet\" seems to be Spain's answer to the US show and to have been toned down or globalized to appeal to a wider audience.

Alberto marries Christina for her money to keep his store afloat. Christina loves Alberto earnestly, yet he continues his flirtations with Ana and one other woman. He cheats on her and treats her badly. And we're still expected to be on his side. Ana is too 'principled' to marry Alberto in a secret ceremony but has no qualms hanging around with a married man, while befriending his unsuspecting wife. It's all a bit hard to reconcile. The characters being 'flawed' is not the problem here, it's that the show carries on strongly making the assumption that you're on their side despite their actions.

Unfortunately, the second season has made me less interested in viewing the show.<br/><br/>I was very interested in the show, because it eluded to the Sex and the City TV show on HBO. Yes, the two shows are not supposed to be based on the same thing; however, this show uses the same characters and references from Sex and the City. Hence, people should expect viewers to want things to stay consistent with the original television broadcast.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Carrie Diaries begins very well and was quite captivating. Unfortunately, as I began watching the second season, Carrie became extremely annoying, primarily because her problems have the same routine in every episode -- she lies about how she feels, the problem builds, she explodes with the truth, and everyone is confused and mad. In special cases, she breaks up with someone... again. After about three episodes of the same thing, I was over it, especially since the script sounds like it is repeating itself. Her character has slowly become unrelatable. In fact, at this point, I have tried to skip through her parts and move onto the other characters, because their problems are more understandable and they have real drama happening.<br/><br/>My last negative comment is that the second season had too much stuff crammed into one season. It was as though they wanted to touch on every major epidemic of the 80s in one season. They did not really build on these epidemics, which made it seem crammed and confusing.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I absolutely love the actors in the show and the characters.

Oh that's right we already have brainwashed them like this, but this show continues that process and ups it a notch.<br/><br/>And lets use inaccurate clich\u00e9s about different things in life to further the brainwashing effect in the process, no spoilers so I won't give examples.

Even though I can't stand the fake pretentiousness it's still somewhat entertaining, but overall forgettable and nothing great.<br/><br/>In spite some reviewers saying that it's completely different than SATC it does use the same basic formula for the show. \"Carrie Bradshaw\" hanging out with her 3 friends but this time it's 2 girls and a guy.

Where we're the true 80's men's men with the testosterone? Plus it was inaccurate &amp; no one wore cloths like that unless your a rich Hollywood star in the 80's.

Little, if any, of the appeal is lost in translating these twisting tales from page to screen. The quality of the original material can be thanked for this but the talents of its legendary cast (Jose Ferrare, Joan Collins, Derek Jacobi, Brian Blessed, Cyril Cusack, etc, etc, etc) must also be acknowledged. The creative cinematography, evocative settings and careful casting also contributes to the series' eerie, expectant feel. The result of all this is a must-see for aficionados of speculative fiction as well as devotees of the author, who won't have to worry about his work being desecrated. He introduces each story himself, offering an evocative glimpse of the mind that <br/><br/>Dahl knew that for a short story to be effective, the reader must be made emotionally dependant on its outcome within the brief space allotted. Subsequently, his characters force a reaction from the reader; whether sympathy, affinity or disgust. Similarly, his plots generate a sense of unease in that you can sometimes guess a few different ways they might end but you're never sure until its done. Even then things often turn out to be worse than imagined. The episodes in 'Tales...' follow this rule religiously; superfluous dialogue is non-existent; a twitch of an eye carries the gravity of a soliloquy. The end result is that viewers find themselves inexorably drawn into the action and, at its conclusion, wonder how a half-an hour long program can resonate in the mind for long afterwards.<br/><br/>Some suggest that 'Tales...' is campy. I can't agree and am perplexed at the opinion. Camp to me triggers thoughts of 'The Benny Hill Show,' the Adam West-era 'Batman' or any other program that takes itself less than seriously. This series couldn't be farther from that genre. Admittedly, the opening credits are dated and were probably unimpressive even at the time, but the show itself is executed in the time-tested traditions that give British drama its fine reputation; its use of humour is sparing, satirical, focused and ghoulishly black. The tone, whether deadly serious or incongruously whimsical all serve to throw the ultimate conclusion into skin-raising contrast.<br/><br/>I think the 'Tales...' are consistently excellent but if I had to name my favourites... <br/><br/>The Man From the South - ironically, Rod Serling's 'Twilight Zone'adapted this tale for TV long before the author himself, <br/><br/>Royal Jelly - a beekeeper's obsession becomes his legacy, <br/><br/>Skin - the tattoo on his back offers a down &amp; out man the chance of a new life <br/><br/>Galloping Foxley - drawn from Dahl's own school days, this story showcases a different type of terror(s) <br/><br/>The Hitchhiker - Cyril Cusack.

This series seems to have mined that particular mine field repeatedly as it's go-to plot structure when choosing which stories to script and film for the series. Thats not a bad thing, but one does eventually get tired of watching Ma vs. Pa and Daddy fussing with Mommy and Honey Bunch rubbing Honey Do the wrong way over and over and over.

Sir John jumped at the chance. As well as a bestselling writer of children's books, Dahl was also known as the literary Hitchcock, the master of the suspenseful short story.<br/><br/>The result was 'Roald Dahl's Tales Of The Unexpected', made by Anglia Television, which ran for the best part of a decade. Some of the stories had been filmed before as part of the U.S. series 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents'. Nevertheless, the show proved hugely popular, attracting the likes of Sir John Gielgud, Joan Collins, Sir Bernard Miles, Sir John Mills, Derek Jacobi, Timothy West, Susan George, Ron Moody, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Brian Blessed, and American actors of the calibre of Telly Savalas, Joseph Cotton, Gloria Grahame, Janet Leigh, Julie Harris and Jack Weston.<br/><br/>The opening titles were an unsettling blend of James Bondian imagery ( a gun, playing cards, a dancing nude woman ) and Gothic horror, backed up by Ron Grainer's carousel-style music. Dahl himself introduced the stories in Hitchcockian fashion. <br/><br/>Ronald Harwood and Robin Chapman penned many of the scripts. Predictably, some stories worked better on television than others. 'Man From The South' got the series off to a fine start, casting Jose Ferrer as a madman who tricks a young American tourist into a bizarre wager which, should he lose, means he forfeits the little finger of his right hand. 'Lamb To The Slaughter' was about the only truly perfect murder ever conceived, whereas 'Neck' had a rich husband revenging himself on his adulterous wife. Easily the worst episode, however, was 'Royal Jelly', the ending of which was not so much unexpected as unspeakable.<br/><br/>Critics renamed the show 'Tales Of The Bleedin' Obvious', yet many episodes did contain genuine surprise endings, such as 'Genesis &amp; Catastrophe' and 'Skin'.<br/><br/>When the production team ran out of Dahl stories to adapt, they turned to the works of other writers.

The content and the background to each storyline often involved murder, often without holding back some visualisation and this lead to it being broadcast late on Sunday evenings.<br/><br/>The series suffered from poor production quality. It is likely that the series was shot on video tape which is evident nowadays. The appearance of studio sets is apparent as there is a definite transition between the quality of lighting indoors and for shooting on location.

As you'd expect with any TV series, there are fantastic, classic episodes and some that aren't so great. Thankfully the great episodes outnumber the not so great quite significantly.<br/><br/>Originally, the series was meant to showcase the stories from Roald Dahl's books \"Tales of the Unexpected\" and \"More Tales of the Unexpected\". Each of these episodes were introduced by Dahl himself in a mock sitting room in front of a roaring fireplace. A short description of where the idea came from regarding the upcoming story then led to 25 minutes of television magic. Each story was meant to end with a twist. Although many did, some had a twist of not actually having a twist but a natural conclusion which you think could never go all the way but it does.<br/><br/>After Dahl's stories ran out, other similarly themed stories were used by well known authors such as Henry Slesar, Bert Salzman, Jeffrey Archer and many others. They didn't have the Dahl introduction and the name \"Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected\" was thus shortened to the familiar \"Tales of the Unexpected\".<br/><br/>Many big names have appeared in the show from Joan Collins, Peter Cushing, Stephanie Cole, Toyah Wilcox, John Mills, Telly Savalas and many, many more. Some early in their careers, others in their prime and some in the twilight.<br/><br/>So if you like a story with a twist ending, you can do far worse than check out this gem. When you hear Ron Grainer's fantastic theme tune starting up and the silhouetted lady dancing in the flames, you'll be gripped for 25 minutes. After that you'll hunger for your next fix of 'The Tales'. <br/><br/>My top 10?<br/><br/>1. The Eavesdropper 2. Would you Believe it? 3. Taste 4. The Tribute 5. The Flypaper 6. Shatterproof 7.

I recall watching it, and seeing John Houseman introduce the episodes. The particular one I can recall seeing (I was on a date the night it was being shown) was shown in April 1983 and called THE MEMORY MAN. Colin Redgrave is an expert in helping people improve their memory by various ways, including hypnosis. He discovers that a new customer (Bernard Cribbins) is having problems with his memory, but also seems quite hostile to questions that Redgrave asks innocently enough. Soon Redgrave remembers that Cribbins had another name, and was involved in a violent robbery where he stole thousand of pounds. Redgrave is slowly using his knowledge of hypnosis to extract the information that Cribbins has forgotten (and so has sought Redgrave's assistance to recall). In the end neither man does too well out of the experience.<br/><br/>When Houseman introduced the episode, he tried to illustrate the problem of memory by shooting out one question after another. One he shot out was, \"Who was the 14th President of the United States?\" I amused my date by shouting out, \"Franklin Pierce\".<br/><br/>Many of the stories are by Roald Dahl, and I suspect, if they are watched, some of them would have to be compared with versions of the same stories (like \"Mrs.Bixby and the Colonel's Coat\") that originally appeared on Alfred Hitchcock Presents (in that case, and in \"Lamb to the Slaughter\", Hitchcock directed the television episodes).

This show is superbly written, incredibly well cast, and very well acted. If you like subtle \"inside-joke\" type humor - this show is for you. Yet at the same time it also does more than enough obvious physical humor to keep younger and more simple-minded viewers enthralled. For example, in one episode there is a bumbling weatherman named BAXTER KNIGHT. A hilarious homage to Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight, on the Mary Tyler Moore Show more than 30 years ago - this reference will be totally lost on 99% of the viewing audience since few were born prior to 2000. In another episode, Selena steals the show by greedily sloughing down all the chocolate deserts on everyone's plates in a fancy restaurant. In that regard, Waverly Place is very similar to all those classic LOONEY TUNES cartoons we all know and love - it can appeal to you on both a very simple AND a very cerebral level. Young children who watch this show today can go back and watch it again in 20 years and they will have an entirely new appreciation all over again, on a whole new level. The entire cast is a joy to watch, but a special tip of the hat to Selena Gomez who is a true delight. This girl shines both as an actress and as a singer. Plus, she is a real sweetheart and totally deserves all the future success she is guaranteed to achieve. Unlike the Lindsays and Britneys of our sad generation, Selena sets a shining example of perfection as a performer, coupled with graceful elegance as a young lady - giving her legions of young fans a more than worthy role model. Selena has released three albums to date, and each one has been better than the last, which is no small feat considering they were all amazing. Most artists today release an album featuring one or two good songs, and 10 really bad ones. Not Selena - ALL of her songs are music to my ears.

The fact that it is \"out of the way\", has gobs of charm, is populated with, he believes, open minded and beautiful women, well Lillehammer is perfect.<br/><br/>As soon as he arrives he is a fish out of water as he lives meagerly next door to the town's female chief of police. Comically, at least initially upon plopping down, he drives around in the polar opposite of the standard mob issue luxo-boat car. Frank Tagliano's world may be under the radar to would-be \"whackers\", but it is akin to him landing on Venus and that's a huge part of the fun.<br/><br/>The entire characters who soon revolve in Frank's new life are Norwegian actors/actresses (after all this is actually made for Norwegians). It is a credit to the talent of those people, plus the writers, that as an American viewer they were quite likable. Of course trouble ensues, but Frank has a kind of \"bulletproof and 10-foot tall\" way about him that easily manages to keep him above water and flush. A guys got to work and for an ex-mob guy what is more natural than owning a bar in a staggering cold place where people stay inside and drink a lot. Oh yeah, put a name implying an escape from the cold on the bar too - The Flamingo Bar. <br/><br/>I won't go into all the characters, but Frank's flunky partner is quite lovable, kind of like a Norwegian new-millennium Barney Fife. The female police chief has a soft soul. The immigration integration guy bumbles and is soon under Frank's thumb. And there is even a love interest for Frank, a woman who is attractive enough, but is even more sweet and unquestioning - U.S. viewers will connect with all of these quite nicely.<br/><br/>In the eight episodes (a very compact season) we see Frank use his muscle and smarts to get into trouble and evade it as his stock in town rises,. It's all done with a non and a wink as nothing is overly heavy, even when there's a couple of murders. Simply put, Lilyhammer doesn't over-reach as it puts a smile on the viewer's face. As already stated, at least for American viewers, the main reason is Steven Van Zandt's Frank Tagliano, however, the rest of the cast fits extremely well for the icing on the cake. Interesting, the show debuted to the largest TV audience for a Norwegian TV show ever and kept it up for it's first season's quick run.

It makes you think long after you've watched it and not many shows or movies have that effect on me as I've watched so many horrors I'm very rarely taken by surprise.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of being creeped out, do yourself a favour.

Six 50 minute episodes that provide a creepy, unsettling and well-written horror story with well-developed characters is quite a new experience.<br/><br/>The show follows Mike Painter, a child psychologist who returns home as a mysterious children's television show called Candle Cove begins airing after over thirty years of absence, a show which, for some mysterious reason, airs at the same time of a mysterious series of deaths.<br/><br/>The show, being six hours long, expands on the ideas set forth in the original short story, and in some sense changes the significance of the Candle Cove story. There is a lot that needed to be changed in order for the story to fit in the television format, but the changes they made not only work but keep to the vision of what creepypastas are all about.<br/><br/>In my mind, while there certainly are some badly written creepypastas out there, what makes the format so unique is the sort of collectivist nature of the story development. For those who don't know, the term creepypasta is from the term copypasta, which of course is slang for copy and paste. This reflects the intentional viral nature of the creepypasta format. These stories are designed to be shared and remixed, rather than locked down via copyright. Just think of Slenderman, arguably the most famous creepypasta icon, who started as a series of images on an image board, and grew into a cultural icon with video games, stories, YouTube series, and even a documentary about him.<br/><br/>That's why, in my opinion, Channel Zero is so great and important.

From the stilted dialogue -- full of awkward pauses, but somehow enhanced as a result -- to the regularly bizarre imagery, to the personality of the hero (antihero?), to the plot itself, which hardly leads to a fairytale ending, nothing in this show takes the easy way out, and all of it is designed to be appreciated by people who love this kind of creepy stuff. For lack of a better analogy, I think this show does to horror TV what \"Aeon Flux\" on MTV did to animated sci-fi series, what \"True Detective\" (Season 1) did to noir, or what \"Twin Peaks\" did to mysteries with a coming-of-age backdrop. In other words, it doesn't just discard the tropes of the genre, it pulls out all the stops at once, and is designed to explore what makes the horror genre truly unique unto itself.<br/><br/>In other words, finally we have a horror show created by people who not only don't feel that a bizarre, eerie sequence needs an explanation, but actually understand that it doesn't really want one.

The few promos I saw intrigued me, though, so I gave the show a shot. I'm not sure whether that was the best or worse decision I have made about a TV series.<br/><br/>This show genuinely disturbed me in ways I honestly didn't know were possible. I'd like to point out that I do not find horror movies even remotely scary--American, Japanese, or otherwise--and \"horror\" shows even less, so I was not expecting that Channel Zero would be the one to freak me out. A huge part of this is due to the production and direction of this series. Considering that the creator/one of the writers/producers of this show was also a writer and co-producer for the show Hannibal, looking back I can see parallels in both storytelling and pacing. Instead of having jump-scares every five seconds, Candle Cove used long, slow, drawn-out shots (sometimes painfully so) to build anticipation and force you to imagine what the heck could possibly be just out of the shot, or what was going to happen. I also have to give major credit to the props, costume, and makeup departments for crafting thoroughly terrifying, organic visuals that never felt clich\u00e9d. The acting was believable, even with the child actors, but there wasn't much chemistry between any of the characters. I'm not sure if this was intentional given the main character's backstory and what's going on in the story, but it's what I've elected to believe. While it felt odd, it wasn't distracting, but did make some interactions less intense or grounded than they probably should have been. At times it seemed like there were a lot of plot-points that didn't seem to lead anywhere, but ultimately the story wrapped itself up nicely, and explained nearly everything...albeit in the freakiest, most nerve-wracking way possible.<br/><br/>Overall, the show was not perfect, but it was solid. I appreciated that it didn't resort to cheap horror scare tactics and tropes, and that it made a simple internet-urban-legend a dark, messed up show that got under my skin.

That night, while drinking at a bar, they learn of the infamous No-End House, a haunt that randomly shows up in a new place every year, targeting people through viral ads. Their friend J.D. seems to know all the answers, but he's easily shown up.<br/><br/>The house itself is all black, foreboding and just standing in the street daring people to enter. The goal: conquer all six rooms. We see the results as numerous people exit the building in tears or vomiting. Whatever is inside is the real deal. And as Margot finds herself falling for Seth - and discovering that perhaps her father isn't as dead as she believed - everyone begins to realize that leaving the house may not be all that easy.<br/><br/>The part that keeps coming back to me in this season is that the house literally eats memories out of your head. Once they're gone, you don't remember them and the house slowly devours every single thing in your head before disposing of you. Then, the house just moves on - another town, another country.<br/><br/>While a completely different story, this season continues a lot of the themes of the first: childhood's loss, the fears that come with growing up, the tests that young friendships must endure as they move toward adulthood and dream sequences that are ready to disquiet you through their imagery and gore.<br/><br/>I'm so excited that more people are discovering this show thanks to Shudder, where season two debuts today.

As a show today it remains such a gem of pop horror culture, and a lot of that is down to John Kassir as the one and only Cryptkeeper.

With a limitless supply of lovably groan-inducing horror-related puns and plays on words, he brought the fun and wrapped up the tales as only he could.

To me, at least the first three seasons had so much heart and wicked love for the craft put into them that you could really feel that they were trying to express in film the dark fun style of the old E.C. comics the same way that the 1972 Amicus film also named \"Tales From the Crypt\" and the 1982 anthology masterpiece \"Creepshow\" had previously done so perfectly. I tried to never miss an episode and even if it had been a bad one I wouldn't have noticed!

Most were horror comedies, but there were more haunting and foreboding horrific offerings such as \"Three's a Crowd\" \"Fitting Punishment\" and especially \"Abra Cadaver\", which sure as hell gets my vote as the scariest episode because it feels like it holds a chilling grain of truth... It really took off fantastically in the second season which I consider the best because it has the biggest concentration of episodes that I personally consider great. The quality sadly did decline a little with each season with spots of greatness here and there, until we finally hit the abominable seventh season, a season that I find so monstrously awful that I don't even care to own it, it was just that cheap and terrible and just so distinctly UN-Crypt. It's the reason I consider there to be 6 seasons of the show, and one runt!

Though also what makes them stand out are the humor which is really dark but it works, just like in the comic stories they don't take themselves too seriously and give the horror a bit of a strange lighthearted sensibility but maintaining it's dark side at the same time. <br/><br/>And also another thing that stand out is in most of the stories the main characters are antagonists that are unlikeable which is interesting switch around from innocent protagonists. This is one of those rare time where you actually route for the main character to get nailed because they've done more bad crap then good and it's high time they pay the piper.<br/><br/>There are plenty of great and memorable stories.

Second Television Terror, this story as a kid gave me the creeps it was a haunted house tale but it was also a satire on the corrupt power of Sensasionalism.

And then there was Vietnam and Watergate. There was total chaos still in places in the south and in larger metropolitan areas in the north. Could television bring these public affairs to light in a comical and thought-provoking way? The answer was a resounding yes as \"All in the Family\" tore down perpetual American television programming walls with brash views, crazed situations, envelope-pushing elements and dominant film-making techniques (even though this was a sitcom) which all merged to paint a canvass of programming superiority that lasted for 212 mind-blowing episodes over nine years from 1971 through 1979. \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in the 1960s displayed how Americans wanted life to be, while \"All in the Family\" in the 1970s showed how American life really was. The result was a ratings monster pretty much from the word go as people watched to be entertained, to be disgusted, to praise and to criticize. The show itself was about a blue-collared New York dock worker (Carroll O'Connor) who has bigoted expressions because life continues to slap him in the face. O'Connor was definitely anti-woman, anti-minority, anti-youth and anti-liberal. He also had crazed views that would show him as being pro-Nixon and pro-Vietnam (real hot button topics back then). The show struck cords the nation over, but comedy was always mixed in and the series thrived due to both its supporters and its detractors. \"All in the Family\" fought problems in the U.S. by poking fun at very serious issues instead of sweeping them under the carpet like other programs of the period did. Jean Stapleton was priceless as O'Connor's kind, naive and somewhat dumb housewife. Sally Struthers was their only child, a liberal who showed the viewpoints of the Baby Boom generation. She was also married to a young man (Rob Reiner) who was O'Connor's emotional and verbal sparring partner. Reiner was of a Polish descent and that only fueled more fire between the volatile pair. O'Connor's Archie Bunker is arguably the deepest and most unique television character of all time as his crazed and sometimes silly views overshadow the fact that he is a highly sensitive middle-class man who is doing the best for himself and those around him. He is someone who does not always think before he speaks and therein lied his greatest weakness. Eventually most who saw the program embraced him as a flawed and tortured hero (not because of who he was, but because of who he really wanted to be). The lasting effect of \"All in the Family\" is something to think about, even today. The program continues to be vitally important to 1970s art, society and history. The success of the program even led to spin-offs galore. \"Maude\", \"The Jeffersons\", \"Archie Bunker's Place\" and \"Gloria\" were all the birth-children of this innovative, smart and completely original taste of Americana that still lives on strong today through many cable channels. 5 stars out of 5.", "rating": null, "helpful": "68 out of 78 found this helpful.", "date": "5 June 2004"}, {"title": " Wow! What a great show", "content": "When All In The Family first came on the air in 1971, you could say that tv was in it's infancy. I mean, when Lucille Ball became pregnant with Desi on her tv show they couldn't even say that word on the air. On the Dick Van Dyke show, they always showed Rob and Laura in seperate beds. All In The Family exploded like a bomb on this innocent world of tv. It showed subjects that were previously taboo like menopause, breast cancer, vasectomies, impotence, rape and even Archie taking a dump and flushing the toilet! Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers all were an amazing team that made tv history. People don't realize that Norman Lear actually based the character of Archie Bunker on his father Herman. His father was basically a good man, but he was very prejudiced like Archie was. He would tell his wife to \"stifle herself\" and there was a special chair in his house that he alone would sit in. He would tell his son that he \"was the laziest white kid he ever knew\". Norman grew up hating his father's prejudices while he still loved his father. Paul Harvey had that on one of his \"Rest Of The Stories\". Carroll O' Connor had started off his acting career in drama and playing Archie gave him the chance to be dramatic on many occasions. The one episode that I remember was one that came on while the Vietnam war was still being fought it was where Mike brought home a friend for Thanksgiving who was a draft dodger and that same night a friend of Archies came over who had lost a son in the war. Archie exploded in rage at Mike (usually on the show when he gets mad its funny because he is just making a fool of himself, but in this episode it is chilling!). There was another episode where Archie had a problem with drugs and delivered a tearful monologue to Edith and Gloria and Mike when they confronted him with his problem. All In The Family spawned the realistic tv shows that we see today and also led to the spin offs Maude and The Jeffersons. Norman Lear created such a wonderful television legacy for all time and it all started with Archie Bunker, America's favorite bigot and All In The Family. His original aim was to create a show that would allow us to look into our own hearts and souls and see our own fears and prejudices and be able to laugh at them. I guess that in a sense you could say that there is a little bit of Archie Bunker in all of us and that is why he remains so endearing and so popular.

It had subjects that were tackled head on including homosexuality,gender roles,racism,war, economy,women's rights,and the choice of abortion(which one episode dealt with that subject),suicide,and birth control, education,child custody and old age.<br/><br/>Even when the commentary of certain items were brought up in the Bunker home,it was always Archie and Micheal(played by Rob Reiner)who quarrel over certain issues in which Archie calls Micheal either a \"meathead\",or \"polark\" because of his European heritage,which in turn made Archie one of the most bigotists people ever made for television.<br/><br/>Its very informative that the commentary on life in America is sometimes light-hearted in a sense,but brings out the bigot in all of us,and makes us think very hard on what we're doing to ourselves and each other.<br/><br/>The show itself had some very powerful episodes here,including one where Edith loses a loved one over his gender(which Jean Stapleton won the emmy for that compelling episode),and the part where Archie falls apart over the death of his wife(very emotional and powerful episode in which Carroll O'Connor won two emmys for his work as Best Actor on the show,and one for Sally Struthers and Rob Reiner as well).<br/><br/>During its initial run on CBS(as \"All In The Family\" from 1971-1979,and as \"Archie Bunker's Place\" from 1979-1982),the show as a whole has a very strong significance and content that applies still to this day,and one of the most influential shows ever to come out of the golden decade of great TV: the 1970's.

First of all, this show pointed out how not every American was a spawn of lace curtain living!! Your average Joe lived in a very modest house, one similar to Achie Bunker's!! Secondly, the changing times of the sixties and seventies brought on mores of behavior that cultural conservatives such as Archie Bunker could not really deal with!! New York City brought on a bevy of cultural stereotypes who compounded Archie's difficulty to cope with a changing era!! The characters in \"All in the Family\" were all well fortified by firmly entrenched political viewpoints which evoked a compelling aura of ignorance and blissful stubbornness!! Eventually, each and every one of them became the recipients of political indiscretions just by virtue of the fact that they were victims of their own hypocrisy!! Archie (Carroll O'Connor) was the bigoted non-dimensional plebeian whom people viewed as irascible and not very easy to understand!! While Archie appeared very cantankerous and closed minded, he was not alone, and was far more common and run of the mill than most people would like to believe!! Edith (Jean Stapleton) his wife, was the simpleton whose good nature prevailed throughout one dose of modern philosophy and spousal rudeness after the next!! Mike (Rob Reiner) the confused and arrogant liberal, (He was my favorite character on the show!!) He thought solutions to real life problems could be attained in text books!! Finally, Gloria (Sally Struthers) was the whining and closely guarded daughter, who took in an egalitarian approach to different lifestyles, as a way of rebelling against her father!! The chemistry with the actors, and actresses and producers and directors of this show became a masterful blend of effective programming through a deliberately flawed and injured comedy!! Almost no other show was fully able to accomplish this!! \"The Honeymooners\" is about the only one I can think of off hand!! I saw an episode last night where Archie saved \"a woman's\" life by giving her mouth to mouth resuscitation, only to find out that this \"woman\" was a transvestite!! It was situations such as these that made this show so popular!! When issues about race, social adversity, sexual preferences and unusual lifestyles are taboo, they cultivate a precarious curiosity which the television audience has, and wants to satisfy!! The conundrum being: Why are these aspects of American culture so hush hush anyway!! \"All in the Family\" was more popular than almost any other T.V.

Controversial \"Laugh-In\" had been racking up big ratings for a couple of years, but second-rate NBC had nothing to lose by taking chances.<br/><br/>Besides broaching all of the controversial topics of the day - abortion, the Vietnam War, homosexuality, and race relations, the show dared to say something that was seldom said on stage or screen before - that bigotry and racism thrived north of the Mason Dixon line, and found particularly safe harbors in some of the urban areas of what is normally thought of as the heart of liberalism. In this case, the Bunker household is in Queens, New York.<br/><br/>The year is 1971, and before outsourcing is even a word, Archie Bunker is able to maintain a middle class lifestyle in New York City with a blue collar job and a stay-at-home wife, Edith. He will never be anything more than he is right then. Archie holds very conservative though not well thought out - or at least not well articulated - viewpoints. And then his 18 year old daughter Gloria marries a liberal. Mike is an atheist with a Polish Catholic background, and stands for everything Archie is against. The icing on the cake - he's a penniless student and he will be a guest in Archie's home for the next several years while he finishes the university degree that will enable him to look down on Archie forever afterwords. It's funny this last point is brought up only once, by the observant if subservient Edith, Archie's wife.<br/><br/>For a few seasons all was well, and then this show and MASH suffered a series of crushing blows - the Vietnam War ended, Nixon was disgraced, and the controversial views held by Archie's son-in-law Mike began to enter the mainstream.

This show beats out \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Honeymooners\", \"Father Knows Best\", \"Burns and Allen\", \"The Cosby Show\", and yes, \"Seinfeld\". And those are only the sitcoms that take a back seat to \"All In The Family\".<br/><br/>\"All In The Family\" was a groundbreaking sitcom, an original, that brought to the forefront many of the problems in society in the 1970's, most of which still exist today. Ageism, racism, sexism, nuclear disarmament, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam War, and even homophobia were deeply examined in this groundbreaking sitcom, as television was no longer relegated to the good old days of perfect nuclear family television. i.e. \"Father Knows Best\", \"Make Room For Daddy\",\"The Donna Reed Show\" and yes, \"The Brady Bunch\".<br/><br/>Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor) is a hard working, lower middle class average Joe, with a loud mouth and silly bigoted views. Many people label Archie as a racist, but he didn't really meet the profile of a true racist. He would never join the KKK, although in a later episode his foolishness nearly got him unwillingly initiated into the group.<br/><br/>Archie is not a true racist because he doesn't have a mean streak. Yes he'll make fun of blacks, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians, Hungarians, and gays, but they're always guests in his little home on 704 Hauser Street in Flushing, Queens.<br/><br/>Archie doesn't hate, he fears. He has just enough financial resources to support \"the dingbat\", his slow witted but honest and kind wife Edith, his \"little goil\", spunky and feminist daughter Gloria, and \"the meathead\", his educated, rabble rousing and ultra liberal son-in-law Mike Stivic.<br/><br/>Mike \"The meathead\" Stivic (Rob Reiner) is highly educated but doesn't often use good common sense, or social smarts. Archie supports him with food, shelter, and entertainment, pays his way through college, lets him have sex with his daughter Gloria up in their bedroom, and even bails \"the meathead\" out of trouble a few times. And all Meathead does is chastise Archie for his vices (ultra-right wing and racist views), never commends him for his virtues (the fact that \"Meathead couldn't survive if Archie didn't work to support him.) He starts so many silly arguments with Archie like the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and even uses Archie's telephone to call the Fair Housing Commision to get Archie into trouble for circulating a petition to keep blacks and Puerto Ricans out of the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Archie's wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) with her \"straight from the dingbat\" comment of \"I don't think you should go where angels fear to tread\", meaning to mind your own business. Meathead should mind his own business. Yes, Archie shouldn't be circulating a petition to keep undesirables out of the neighborhood, nor should he bad mouth blacks, Puerto Ricans, Asians, Jews, etc. But that doesn't make it educated college boy's business to interfere with Archie's. If Mike would assert himself more intelligently with Archie instead of all of these silly arguments, there would be less tension in the Bunker household. But unfortunately, \"All In The Family\" then wouldn't have been the great situation comedy that it was.<br/><br/>If you have to pick the smartest person in the Bunker household, your first pick would probably be Mike \"Meathead\" Stivic or his wife and Archie's daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers), because they are the most worldly and racially tolerant. However the true brain of the Bunker household is really Edith. She likes people and she knows how to get along with everyone. No one but occasionally Archie gets angry with Edith, because she is tolerant, kind, honest, and considerate. However, sometimes she's too honest and this drives Archie batty.<br/><br/>There is a self-defense technique called jujitsu in which you throw people in the way they are already headed. Edith unconsciously uses this technique against Archie. He'll make some wild racial slur to get the CBS studio audience balling with laughter, and then Edith will top him with some dingbatty punchline. Normally she's slow witted but often she gets the better word on Archie.<br/><br/>For example: Archie: \"In my day there was nothing, I mean nothing until the wedding night.\" Edith: \"Even Then.\" Archie: \"You have the nerve, Michael Stivic Meathead, to write a letter to the president about your rash!\" Edith: \"Maybe he knows a good skin man.\" Then there was the episode when Archie's niece Linda was dating Lionel, his black neighbor and friend. Edith is frantically trying to hide the portrait of Linda and Lionel together. Edith out dingbats herself. Archie sees the picture and goes ballistic.<br/><br/>One of the funniest episodes was \"Edith's Problem\" when she's going through menopause, is flipping out and turns on Archie. She orders him to \"Stifle\", like he's told her to do hundreds of times.<br/><br/>I have one more thing to add about \"All In The Family\". I have worked in many warehouse/ loading dock jobs like Archie does. And from this great sitcom, I never heard the terms, \"pallet\", \"pallet jack\", \"skinny\", \"skid\", or \"conveyor belt\". What I mean is that even even on this great show, work is like non-existent. That is the problem with television.

The problem he ran into at the time was that Archie, designed to be a mean spirited bigot, instantly became a working class hero to millions of people.  He was the \"lovable bigot\" as he so often was and still is referred to. As the series fades   and becomes dated, the suberbly nuanced acting of Caroll O'Connor continues on and cements the character of Archie as a real human being--with both flaws and virtues. <br/><br/>\nIf one watches the show over time, and I can still remember when it first began, one realizes that Archie is a lot more than just some cardboard bigot.  The character dropped out of high school to support his family after his father died.  His family grew up poor during the depression, not much hope and not much opportunity.  He labors with his hands all week at a loading dock and sees the world changing around him, and hears society accusing him of being the villain because he loves his country and believes in family and God.  He's comically set in his ways--one should always put the toilet paper so the paper hangs away from the wall rather than toward it; one absolutely must put both socks on before putting shoes on--almost a moral imperative.  And he loves his wife and daughter, provides a stable home, never got divorced and ultimately managed to buy a little business of his own and prosper.  He was ignorant, yes, but not evil. <br/><br/>\nCompare that to Mike, perpetually in school, hopelessly egotistical, highly educated yet lacking in common sense.  He sponges off of Archie all the while attacking him and the things he believes.  Remember the scene where he needlessly rankles Archie by declaring that the \"Star Spangled Banner\" is a \"stupid song\" because one word \"yet\" covers two musical notes and hence is pronounced \"ye-et\".  This is what college and graduate school get him? Mike ultimately gets a divorce from Gloria who has to care for her child alone, becomes a radical university professor and participates in Nuclear power protests in the nude--an altogether nauseating character.<br/><br/>The series portrays a clash of values, characters and generations, made even more interesting since the younger generation coming after Stivic's ended up idolizing conservative Ronald Reagan and creating a new entrepeneurial economy.  Even liberalism seems to have repudiated peacenik Stivic, with a left leaning President embracing dictatorships and bombing countries on a regular basis. <br/><br/>All In The Family as a whole is dated--it is an interesting look at the mentality of the 1970's.  The only thing that remains fresh are the characters rather than the issues they argue about. And comparing the complexities of the characters, Archie's qualities, despite all his faults, are a good deal better than his egotistical and self serving daughter and son-in-law.", "rating": null, "helpful": "9 out of 19 found this helpful.", "date": "29 June 2000"}, {"title": " Disgusting Elitist Propaganda", "content": "Now I know why they call TV shows 'programming'.

It tackles mature themes that I would expect coming from a Seinen manga, and this is made even better with the interesting use of its characters. Even if they were animals, it got me invested because of the worldbuilding, the depiction of carnivores and herbivores, and the conflicts that the world revolves around in. Also, I find it very interesting that I can empathize with a fictional, anthropomorphic, gray wolf who has anxiety issues. From the first season alone, I can already say that these are well-written characters, especially Legoshi, Haru, and Louie.<br/><br/>The animation was different than what I expected, but in a good way. I would have been fine with the stop-motion animation like in the opening, but the use of 3D animation and CGI were pretty good.

I was moved to tears in the first 8 minutes of the story, at the time when it was impossible to be attached to the characters. This alone shows how good the writing is. Story also covers many problems of society we live in (drugs, addiction, racism, segregation, etc.) The anime is based on a manga created by Paru Itagaki. Just few episodes into the anime, I could not get enough of the story and decided to read the manga. 150 chapters later, and I really love the story. If you stick to it in the first few minutes, you will find yourself craving for more.<br/><br/>There is a controversy concerning that studio Orange chose to use CGI animation instead of drawing, and you know what; this is the best CGI animation I have seen in a TV series yet! Sure, it has its moments but those moments are so rare, you will hardly notice them. Some scenes are motion captured which means that the characters move insanelly realisticly.<br/><br/>Voice acting and soundtracks are on another level, every sad scene makes your eyes water, every cheerful and happy scene makes you feel great for the characters.

The first name is Fictional, made-up. He is the product of human imagination, more of a symbol of Law &amp; Order than a character in a story.<br/><br/>Even though the young Mr. Webb had the desire to become a Comedian and having his own Radio Show, much like his boyhood idol, Jack Benny, things don't always work out the way we envision them. (And the World can and may well be better off for it!) For it was his success with DRAGNET\"Radio Show, which soon morphed into \"DRAGNET\" TV Series (1951-1959), that gave a great share of immortality to Jack in our American Pop Culture.<br/><br/>As time moved along, Mr. Webb became a creative force to several other Law Enforcement themed series. We saw his Production Company's Trademark of a strong, sinewy, sweaty, grimy hands pounding a flat lettering chisel-stamp, with the Hammer Striking and leaving the words: \"A Mark VII, Ltd. Production\", on quite a few series. Following the trail blazing accomplishments of \"DRAGNET\", we received several of these for our approval, as Rod Serling used to say.<br/><br/>So Mr. Webb brought us \"O'HARE, U.S. TREASURY\"(1971) with David Jansen, the longevity prone \"EMERGENCY!(1972-79), and the equally long running, second most recognized as \"a Jack Webb production \"ADAM 12\"(1968-75).<br/><br/>In \"ADAM 12\", Jack pushed the Envelope forward as far as the celluloid portrayal of Big City Cops goes. Using all the experience from his for incarnations of \"DRAGNET\", he let loose a sure winner with the TV Audience, as well as a continuing favourite with the Criticsizers (o.k., okay! It's 'Critics', I knew it all along!) In looking back to those years of the Late 1960's to the Early 1970's, we as a Nation (the U.S. A., that is, Schultz!)were all caught up in what was probably the High Water Mark of the 'Counter-Culture' Hippy/Yippie/Flippy Anti-Authority,Anti-Establishment, Anti-Cop media tirades of that period. This was the Era of Assassination, with John F. Kennedy (1963), Martin Luther King (1968) and Robert Kennedy (also '68), all dying at the hands of murderers with Political motivations. And there were other incidents such as the attempted Murder of Former Alabama Governor George Wallace in May of 1972.<br/><br/>In addition, we had subversive groups infiltrating Movements of War Protest, the Greatest example being the Rioting in the Streets of Chicago (\"\u0085My kind of Town!\") during that Week-Long Democratic National Convention in August 1968. Next would likely be their highly return in the following year of 1969 for their Self-Proclaimed \"Days of Rage\", October 5-11.<br/><br/>The same Left Wing Organizations also used their influence to turn Urban Rioting following events like the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to a sort of Urban Sedition. Aided by certain sensational headlines driven manipulators in the News Media, all blame seemed to be put on the Uniformed Police charged with doing something about it.<br/><br/>And always being a guy sympathetic to the thankless plight of the Cops, Mr.Webb set out to give us a dramatized version of just what it was like to be on the other end of that on- going struggle.<br/><br/>Essentially, Jack Webb rendered a series which could to be said is a \"Dragnet of, by and for the Uniformed Police. In spite of some criticisms, such as being a little preachy in its story lines and stilted in the language employed, it certainly deserves to be rated as a top series of its time.

Joe Friday.<br/><br/>Then in the late 60's Webb created a show that was Cops before that show was even a concept. The idea was to show people the daily routines of police officers working on the beat. In practice, it was a great idea, and still is. Adam-12 was that show. A simple, straightforward show about police work. The show was aimed at a universal audience, which by today's standards would be unacceptable because no one over the age of 12 would take it seriously. Because today we've been treated to shows like Cops &amp; Live PD which gives us no filters, no drama, just straight police work. And considering how we all know how real confrontations between police &amp; people go thanks to these shows it makes Adam-12 humorous when you see how the drama plays out and you know as a viewer that the people in the show don't have their bad words bleeped out. It's also from a time when the police had a black &amp; white view of drug use and to watch episodes where people get busted on marijuana possession is hilarious to how serious Malloy is when he tells the suspects about how dangerous marijuana is.<br/><br/>Officer Pete Malloy is an LAPD officer who has witnessed his partner get killed in the line of duty. Considering retiring, He is given a new partner, a fresh out of the academy 23 year old by the name of Jim Reed. Over 7 seasons, Malloy takes Reed under his wing and the 2 men maintain law &amp; order in Los Angeles, and confront a variety of people who range from psychotic killers to troubled teens. Over time, Reed goes from a young father to an experienced beat cop who takes other police under his wing while Malloy takes more responsible roles within the department.<br/><br/>This one's truly a gem of it's time, but you cannot take it as seriously as you could have back when it initially aired.

Trump didn't make it the process any worse then it's been for decades but now the level of ignorance is so high; it's insane. My largest problem is that this show takes importance of cultures and other countries and just throws them out the window. Of course, everyone has been told families are very close in other cultures; much more then ours. But you don't really know that being an American. I had to learn as well but no matter what country another person is coming from; better or worse, these people are having to think of leaving a very strong familial circle. Yet all these people and Americans in general have this arrogant idea that they are getting a favor from a green card. These are real people we are talking about. People whom have lives we can't know. My husband is from Italy for crying out loud. There are some from Europe and the only thing they are told is that they're lucky to come here. Has anyone been to these countries and cities outside the US? I lived in Italy and saw much of Spain and here to tell you, there is a beauty and culture I had much difficulty leaving. My husband sacrificed for my kids and myself to leave his family and beloved home when we came back to the US. If you go into this kind of situation, be aware from the first email that you will have to do things much differently. Learn the other culture, TALK to your so on those hundreds of texts and messages. Give the other importance always and be understanding of differences. We assumed no trust at first. We communicated to the other what we expected, time lines, etc. as well as all the difficulties we could face. We began after the first months when we decided to take it more then friendship that it was all or nothing. We prepared research for each im about the other's culture, world views and questions. From the beginning, when he or I called, we made certain to answer where we were, take photos of the moment and send, etc. until we met several times enough to trust and we communicated this verbally. But most important, I was very open and sensitive to the fact he was talking to an American and how much he loved his own culture. When we talked about where we would end up (and we did this for almost 2 years and 5 times meeting with separations) I was very, very considerate of his life there. His family and responsibilities were more important to him. I worked hard to move my children and myself to his country and retired early from the school system. His mother needed him as did his whole family that centered around him. Sacrifices. That is what you need to know going into this. Compromise, honesty, respect of other cultures and putting the other person first. Probably the truest test of love. I think these people needed help understanding that. When we arrived back to the US a few years ago, I had to be separated for 18 months during the process. There were no problems other then a lawyer that was not diligent about one piece of paper needed. It is just a very long process.

That's not to say that certain series, such as the early Gunsmoke, were not daring and edgy in their own way. Or that the early I Love Lucy did not have its hilarious moments. However the governing concepts were unadventurous at best, or just plain dull, at worst. After all, no matter how good some of the episodes, bringing law and order to the Old West or following the humorous escapades of a zany housewife were not exactly novel concepts in TV programming.<br/><br/>Two series, however, did come along to challenge convention. The Twilight Zone, at decade's end, attacked frontally with huge doses of imagination and exotic story-lines that often overwhelmed viewers, thereby opening American living-rooms to the expanding world of unthought-of possibilities. It was, and remains, a classic appreciated by young and old alike. However, the other ground-breaking series did not attack frontally. Instead, in true stealthy fashion, it snuck past the guardians of Good Taste and Morality, otherwise known as the department of Standards and Practices. That's probably because each episode was introduced by a funny-looking fat guy with a British accent, who came out to crack a few bad jokes and abuse the sponsors. Who could suspect that what followed such a slow-talking Humpty-Dumpty would subtly undermine some of TV's most entrenched conventions.<br/><br/>Yet that's exactly what the Hitchcock half-hours did. Perhaps the most subversive change lay in the series's really sneaky treatment of wrong-doers. To that point, convention insisted that culprits be apprehended on screen, the better to teach the audience that Crime Doesn't Pay. And while that may have conveyed a comforting societal message, it also made for a very predictable and boring climax to even the best stories. What the Hitchcock show did that was slyly revolutionary was to transpose the comeuppance from the story to Hitchcock's often humorous epilogue. There the audience would learn that the culprit was duly punished and that justice had once again prevailed, apparently enough to keep the censors of the day at bay. So the story-line might end on screen with a grotesque murder, while only later would the audience be told by Hitchcock that justice had indeed caught up. Maybe that seems like just a minor change. But in fact, it was highly significant. For now the audience could follow plot developments, without knowing how the story itself would end, while the deadening element of predictability was transferred to the easily ignored epilogue. It was a truly ground-breaking event in the evolution of TV.<br/><br/>All in all, that element of uncertainty made for the kind of programming that continues to entertain, even into today's super-charged era of technicolor and relaxed censorship. It also accounts largely for why Hitchcock Presents remains one of the few series from that long-ago time to still be re-run. There were other sly subversive wrinkles such as the black humor that sometimes accompanied the most heinous crimes. Or the subtle insistence that murder often begins at home. In fact, the series as a whole managed to mirror much of Hitchcock's movie-making personality, which suggests the producers (Norman Lloyd and Joan Harrison) were very protective of what the Hitchcock brand name implied. Anyway, like any other series, some episodes were better than others, but only rarely did one really disappoint. In fact, the high quality remained surprisingly steady throughout the half-hour run, before dropping off noticeably during the over-stretched hour-long version.<br/><br/>Some of my favorites: \"Mr. Pelham\" (good semi sc-fi); \"The Creeper\" (suspense &amp; fine acting); \"The Glass Eye\" ( well-done horror); \"Back for Christmas\" (typical Hitchcock irony); \"Poison\" (you'll sweat a bucket load); \"Design for Loving\" (off-beat premise well executed); \"Human Interest Story\" (Hitchcock meets the Twilight Zone); \"Special Delivery\" (truly spooky); \"Specialty of the House\" (It ain't Mc Donalds); \"Breakdown\" (Why don't they hear me?), and anything with the deliciously repulsive Robert Emhardt.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are many others not so fresh in my memory. Anyway, in my book, a big thanks is due Alfred Hitchcock for doing something no other movie heavy-weight of the time was willing to do. He risked his big league reputation by squeezing into millions of little black boxes once a week for seven years to bring the audience outstanding entertainment.

Aided by producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd, Hitchcock owned the show through his production company, yet actually had little to do with the series, of which he directed only a small number of episodes. But Harrison and Lloyd knew Hitch and his tastes quite well, and the Hitchcock shows reflected his interests and preoccupations. He also delivered the droll introductions, which are still a joy to watch, becoming somewhat of a celebrity as a result. Drawing on such disparate sources as Ray Bradbury and John Collier, Ambrose Bierce and Guy de Maupassant, the show drew on some of the most gifted actors (if not biggest stars) in the business.

The series' original half-hour anthology format provided a perfect showcase for stories of mystery, suspense, and the macabre that reflected Hitchcock's established persona. Every Sunday at 9:30 p.m., the series began with the familiar theme of Gounod's \"Funeral March of a Marionette\" (which would thereafter be inextricably linked with Hitchcock), and as Hitchcock's trademark profile sketch was overshadowed by the familiar silhouette of Hitchcock himself, the weekly \"play\" opened and closed with the series' most popular feature: As a good-natured host whose inimitable presence made him a global celebrity, Hitchcock delivered droll, dryly sardonic introductions and epilogues to each week's episode, flawlessly written by James Allardyce and frequently taking polite pot-shots at CBS sponsors, or skirting around broadcast standards (which demanded that no crime could go unpunished) by humorously explaining how the show's killers and criminals were always brought to justice... though always with a nod and a wink to the viewer. This knowing complicity was Hitchcock's pact with his audience, and the secret to his (and the series') long-term success. It's also what attracted a stable of talented writers whose tele plays, both original and adapted, maintained a high standard of excellence. Hitchcock directed four of the first season's 39 episodes, including the premiere episode \"Revenge\" (a fan favorite, with future Psycho costar Vera Miles) and the season highlight \"Breakdown,\" with Joseph Cotten as a car-accident victim, paralyzed and motionless, who's nearly left for dead; it's a perfect example of visual and narrative economy, executed with a master's touch. (The fourth episode, \"Don't Come Back Alive,\" is also a popular favorite, with the kind of sinister twist that became a series trademark.) Robert Stevenson directed the majority of the remaining episodes with similar skill, serving tightly plotted tales (selected by associate producers Joan Harrison and Norman Lloyd) by such literary greats as Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Cornell Woolrich, Dorothy L. Sayers, and John Collier. Adding to the series' prestige was a weekly roster of new and seasoned stars, with first-season appearances by Cloris Leachman, Darren McGavin, Everett Sloane, Peter Lawford, Charles Bronson, Barry Fitzgerald, John Cassavetes, Joanne Woodward, Thelma Ritter, and a host of Hollywood's best-known character players. With such stellar talent on weekly display, Alfred Hitchcock Presents paved the way for Thriller, The Twilight Zone, and other series that maximized the anthology format's storytelling potential.<br/><br/>Packed onto three double-sided DVDs, these 39 episodes hold up remarkably well, and while some prints show the wear and tear of syndication, they look and sound surprisingly good (although audio compression will cause many viewers to turn up the volume). The 15-minute bonus featurette, \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents: A Look Back\" is perfunctory at best, but it's nice to see new anecdotal interviews with Norman Lloyd, assistant director Hilton Green, and Hitchcock's daughter Pat (a frequent performer on these episodes), who survived to see their popular series benefit from the archival convenience of DVD.<br/><br/>Starring: Alred Hitchcock (Host) Director: Robert Stevens.", "rating": null, "helpful": "16 out of 18 found this helpful.", "date": "16 June 2008"}, {"title": " even if you've only seen a few episodes, it's still great", "content": "I've only seen a few episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", but just those few identify it as a great show.

Snappily scripted, plotted and edited, these short programmes prefigure the likes of \"Twilight Zone\" in the 60's and \"Tales Of The Unexpected\" in the 70's. The production values are high as is the acting talent involved; famously this is how Hitch discovered Vera Miles, who was to feature in two of his features in the years ahead as well as a penchant for a low budget, black and white shoot which would result in a certain movie centring on a psychologically disturbed motel owner, the title of which escapes me. All the episodes benefit from acerbic intros and outros by the man himself, playing up to his curmudgeonly persona while the sinisterly jocular theme music still conjures up that famous pencil-profile image which he would fill over the titles.

Therefore, I am asking anyone if s/he has any information beyond what I can provide below, I would greatly appreciate a reply. Any information such as the year in which it aired, the name of the episode, any actors involved, plot details, etc. would be most appreciated. I have thought about this episode, and have been a bit haunted by it, for years.<br/><br/>All I remember is that there were three (I believe that it was three) nurses who either lived together or were just visiting each other at one of their homes one evening. They might have also been keeping each other company that night because word was out that a night stalker/murderer was on the prowl in their neighborhood, possibly killing only nurses. So, in order to keep each other company and protect each other, they decided to spend at least this one particular night all together. And here, my memory really is fuzzy. But, I believe that one of these nurses, whose name is Stella, then becomes sick, and so one of the other nurses, who is quite hefty, walks over to her and begins to check her for fever, etc. After a few minutes, this \"doting\" nurse then begins to slowly strangle Stella, and tells her \"you have such a pretty face, Stella\"....but \"she\" now talks in her real voice, which is a man's. Upon realizing that this strangling nurse must be the psychopath who's on the prowl, Stella starts to scream, and rips off the man's wig at the same time. The effect was completely unsettling. I remember the image of this fat man dressed in drag queen white pancake makeup with his natural hair plastered against his head, to allow for the wig. It was a chilling, very scary image to see his ugly though still somewhat effeminate, dragged-up face with piercing blue eyes, very red lips, fat, pasty, pancacky cheeks, juxtaposed against the sound of his now real, very low, male voice, as he strangles the nurse. I remember talking about this episode in class the next day, in third grade, as well as not being able to sleep for weeks. Can anyone fill in the undoubtedly many blanks I have in my recollection?

THE other reviews have mentioned enough about everything except for the one thing I believe was the real key to this huge success:Tayyar and Metin(Faith) Dundar. The character of Tayyar is new to the drama he represent pure evil a wolf disguised as lamb and his worst deeds was his son Metin. The first is a successful businessman who has charitable initiatives and has wife and son and everyone loves him, but he hides a criminal aspect of organic trading and money laundering. He has a secret son who he adopted as his nephew and made him a criminal and his right hand his nick name is Metin. Metin is young man who was born of a crime (Tayyar raped his mother and then cut her tongue off)and grew up in the dark to become a psycho planning to avenge Tayyar in closest chances. But something happens to change his life forever when he falls in love with his prisoner, which teaches him love and represents for him everything that was missing compassion and innocence. Tayyar relationships and implementation makes his arrest impossible and develops events in the series of trying to solve the mystery of the death of Elife's father and Omar fianc\u00e9e to reveal the threads about the involvement of Tayyar and Metin and develop at an accelerated pace holding breath until it ends before picking it up.They get to know the truth and discover lots of facts about life,family,friends and love.Although i didn't like the ending very well, i expected better but still was good (for Turkish they adore sad endings so i should be grateful hahaha). The writers innovated unique characters, especially strong mentally, and emotionally eg: Metin: even made him a victim sympathize with others despite his cruelty! we loved the bad boy here , they even called best TV bastard ever . As the director put best selection of scenes and the use of music of genius Toygar \u0131\u015f\u0131kl\u0131 and generosity in production , the wonderful cast , devoted crew...etc all these elements led to the success of the series and fame. And I disagree with those who say that the reason for success is Omar and Elif love story because the story between them is not new or attractive, same old boring story, and doesn't evolve or give much pleasure or romance. Tuba (Elif) didn't act very well to prove her love to the audience, especially in the second season. The rest of the actors were very good, especially Saygin Soysal, who dazzled people with his successful coup for a psychopathic in love and seeking revenge.

I usually hate Turkish series(I only watched Ezel before this) because they are all the same,based on the same story but just with different characters/locations. Fortunately,I was actually forced to watch this because I was in a hospital and my TV remote didn't work,so i was stuck on just one channel for 8 days. At first I was very suspicious because I had some stereotypes about Turkish TV series,but on the third day I was actually enjoying watching it. So what makes Kara Para Ask stand out in infinite bland of weeping women,endless tea drinking(they even rival the British people :D),and more weeping?<br/><br/>THE GOOD: -Outstanding acting,especially for one Turkish series<br/><br/>Explanation:The two main actors,Omer and Elif,are excellent and believable characters,their role really suits their appearance/style. Even antagonists(Tajar,Metin,miss Nedret)are really good and you actually start to hate them,which is always a sign that they nailed their acting. The only mediocre actress was definitely Nilufer(she is truly annoying as somebody already wrote).<br/><br/>-Gorgeous locations<br/><br/>Explanation:Turkey is really a beautiful country,and this series really make the best of it stand out,with its top-notch camera work.The best thing is that there are actually quite a few locations in the series,as opposed to your usual Turkish series where there is like 3 houses in the whole series :D<br/><br/>-Beautiful soundtrack<br/><br/>Explanation:I fell in love with the sounds and songs of this series.I actually went so far that I downloaded 2 songs from it because they were perfect to play while having,um,some fun with my girlfriend.They really make everything much more compelling and believable.<br/><br/>And I left the best for the end: -Amazing story<br/><br/>Explanation:The story is just a whole new level for the Turkish series.However they didn't even went far from your usual \"love wins all\" story,they just upgraded it.Instead of some usual characters you really have unique ones,everyone has its own strengths and weaknesses,and when Omer and Elif try to break through some tough times you are really sympathizing with them.The story is not just centered on the love of the two protagonists,its also centered on their families,and even love stories of some minor characters(Metin- Nilufer). All this really makes it stand out.The best thing:they minimized weeping,although some characters just can't do without it(Yes I'm looking at you Nilufer,if your tea isn't sweet enough that's not a reason to cry :D).Without all the tears the series actually just gained on emotional side.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>-Unrealistic violence<br/><br/>Explanation:Although Turkish censorship is pretty strict(no sex scenes,violence,even swearing),they could at least make it more believable by putting more realistic muzzle flashes/gun smoke because its pretty visible that it's fake.Another drawback is that every character holds the gun somehow awkward,even those who should know how to hold it(Omer/Husejin/other police officers). Yet another drawback is totally unrealistic wounds,I mean when you get shot to the head there is really a lot of blood,not just small red blurred dot.I know this ain't Saw or something but that could definitely be better.<br/><br/>-Some kiss scenes were awkward AF<br/><br/>Explanation:Although I know not anybody can make out like me :D a.k.a Casanova style,it's still somewhat expected when 2 people are married that they French kiss instead of your 10 year old kisses.The funniest thing is when Metin and Nilufer are making out because you can clearly see that there is no passion involved and Nilufer acts like she is kissing a Chernobyl boar,and not a human being(I can actually understand that,'cause Metin/Faith is ugly AF :D) But still,could be way better.<br/><br/>-A bit repetitive plot<br/><br/>Explanation:I already told that the story was cool,but after watching it for a while you really get used to all the plot twists and you can easily predict what will happen next.I don't know,maybe it's just me but after episode 40 i almost knew everything in advance.Sometimes you should just make thing go as planned,without any problems.<br/><br/>That's it,thanks for reading! :)", "rating": 9, "helpful": "35 out of 43 found this helpful.", "date": "1 September 2015"}, {"title": " 150 hours of rollercoaster , A deadly combo of Action, Deception, life lessons and an unforgettable unconditional love.", "content": "The best and worst part of Kara Para Ask is it's length - it drains you out and at the same time, hooks you at the edge of the seat.

Lke Korean dramas too, There is the girl from his past. But unlike k-dramas, this is not a character with bad intentions. but someone who under different circumstances could have been the heroine of the story. Someone also has designs on Elif. Unlike Korean dramas. there is a lot of kissing and hugging in this. Actually, for me it got too sappy. But perhaps that says more about me. Yep, Hugging seems to very popular in Turkey. It's not only hugging between the two leads, but also between families, and friends of families. There is a archvillain in this. Although you find out pretty early. It was quite a shock. Murders are committed by him, and for him. There are kidnappings, and shoot outs. In The area of excitement, the drama doesn't let you down. There are many characters, my favourite being Pelin. The song does not feature in the series. But there is some wonderful Turkish music What are the real faults of the drama. Well, as in Korean dramas, there are scenes where it looks like somebody is going to die. But they don't. Although not everyone survives. I'm not sure if this happens in Korean dramas. But the same things to more than one character. eg pregnacy. There are some scenes meant to convey tension, but you know what's going to happen. I guess also as some korean dramas, blood and gore are not seen<br/><br/>All the main characters are well drawn. and many of the minor characters too. The acting is terrific, and I can't fault anybody. One character is a bit of a crybaby. but in some ways her story is the most compelling, because you are not quiet sure how it will turn out. The drama will you give insight into Turkish culture, and their sayings. It aso shows the difference between Omar's family, who I guess are more traditional, and Elif's who are more modern.

Being a sitcom,of course there is plenty of the easy,comedic rhythm that you'd expect out of a show of its make,only the just a touch of sharp,knowing sass and a 21st century sensibility to it.<br/><br/>A very fine supporting cast sports Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold as CHris' dad and mom,Imani Hakim as his younger sister and Tequan Richjmond as his older(?)brother,and Vincent Martella as is his best friend. I've only FINALLY nailed down when this show runs(and where the local CW is located on the dial),so I must confess that I've only seen a handful of shows,but what I've sen is quite good.

It delivers and delivers well indeed.<br/><br/>Let me break down what's so good about Everybody Hates Chris: The fantasy scenes. Most of them are taken from Chris Rock's thought that he performed in his stand ups. Obviously the one that finally got made in the series are the tame ones. However I like this feature because normally in the sitcoms, they just talk about it, not really showing the funny possibilities it ala the Simpsons or Family Guy. Although it take out some of the funny point that you have while imagining it, but so far Everybody Hates Chris shows the funniest non-cartoon fantasy scenes on TV.<br/><br/>A black comedy which is not that black. Without being racist, this comedy is not that 'black' I mean everybody can watch it, enjoy it, and relate to it. I don't think Everybody Hates Chris only applies to a specific race group. I am an Oriental dude and I still laughed my ass off watching the show.<br/><br/>A black comedy which is not being white. Now this is very important. Remember the Cosby Show, anyone? But I just think that it's too white, similar to Fresh Prince from Bel Air. Those shows were kind of like white people's comedy, but they have black actors. Without being racist again, the series shows a natural and honest look of African American family, where the father is not a doctor or a lawyer. They barely made the end's meet, not living in a house with ten bedrooms. But above all they are happy.<br/><br/>Chris Rock as the narrator did a great job in connecting the show with us in this time period. Many of his comments are showing the results of the trends or what happened in the period that affects popular culture in our period. For examples are the many hip hop references Chris narrated.<br/><br/>The soundtracks are awesome. The songs are in the same time period when the show is supposed to be set.<br/><br/>The kid's expression. The kid actors in the series are top-notch. They act naturally and I love their expressions. They seem to be innocent and their faces show a willingness to learn and to know new things, which are very typical kids' reaction to the new stuffs they experience.<br/><br/>Everybody Hates Chris is a great sit-com.

Then in one episode they showed that Tanya was carrying on the torch and being disruptive in her class. I really hope that other races don't look at black woman as if we all carry on this way at home because we do not. Even if Chris Rock's mother really was this way he should have had the character portrayed differently. On the other hand, if she wasn't really this way and he thought this portrayal would be funnier or resonate more with black youths, he discredited her and all black women by feeding into the stereotype. She has her funny moments, but I mostly hate her character because she keeps screaming at the top of her lungs about everything. I don't want to be in a real person's presence who is like this, so I would not want to spend my time being exposed to them on TV.<br/><br/>The situations that Chris' character finds himself in are funnier than the character himself. Probably this role should have gone to a better child actor.<br/><br/>The real gen of the show to me is Julius. It is hilarious how he counts every penny. Some call it cheap, but I call it being responsible. And I remember doing many of the things he did on the show, such as calling someone collect and leaving a quick message into of your name so it goes through for free and buying only off-brand foods.<br/><br/>I hated when Tisha Campbell joined the cast. Not sure why I was surprised since she and Tichina Arnold are BFFs, so where you see one you will eventually see another. But this is a trend they have got to break. On this show, Campbell's character as Tasha's ex-con mother was annoying at best. I did not like her appearance in one episode. And that high-pitched voice she used for that character grated on my nerves. It was so unnecessary and stupid. I'm already not a fan of Campbell in anything she has done (even on Martin, she really only came through on two episodes - the one where she had a shot of Novocaine and went to Martin's high school reunion and the one where her head got stuck in the headboard).

Growing up is never easy but in Chris' case it is even harder because he has to attend a 99% white school a long bus ride away; his father works two jobs and tries to save every single penny that comes his way; his mother is tough and domineering; his younger brother is cuter and more popular than him and his baby sister is pretty much his responsibility but takes every chance she gets to land him in trouble.<br/><br/>Along with \"My Name is Earl\" this sitcom landed in the UK being hailed by critics as the saviour of the sitcom in the US. As someone who has been left uninspired and bored by the bland flavour of Friends, Raymond, Just Shoot Me and countless other safe, studio-bound sitcoms this was an offer I couldn't turn down and I'm very glad to say that I wasn't disappointed. Taking liberties with reality is the great strength of the show as, seen through the eyes of a child, it is twisted and blessed with imaginative touches and asides. The basic plots generally avoid easy sentimentality and as a result it is a much more convincing sitcom world than the all-white, all-middle-class worlds of the majority of comedies, which generally leave me feeling like they exist in no world I have ever seen. The sibling squabbling, penny-pinching, fighting and conflicts are all much more realistic and the fact that the plots are rarely contrived makes them all the better. The simplicity of them would be a problem though, but this is where the asides and narration come in, because they both inject outlandish laughs and wit into the material.<br/><br/>The cast are generally pretty good. Rock's narration is hardly his best material but he delivers it well, although ironically the biggest laughs are on the screen, not in his dialogue. Williams does a great job as the young Chris; he is likable, convincing and fun \u0096 really able to carry the show to the point that he makes it look easy. Crews is really well cast and I enjoyed his character a great deal. Arnold dominates the best lines with a character that is always skating close to being a bit of racial caricature but she keeps in the realm of character (just about) with a good performance. Richmond is solid but has the least to do on a regular basis. Hakim is a very simple, finger-snapping clich\u00e9 but my God is she funny, she reminds me of a similar girl I know who has a very similar background and character, so from that all I can say is that she is convincing and realistic. The direction is good and visually the series feels like it is set in a real world rather than a studio \u0096 the streets are real, the classrooms feel real and the family home itself feels very real. The selection of music is generally very good (and well used) and the sense of period is well judged. Needless to say, the lack of canned laughter was only ever going to be a massive plus point.<br/><br/>Overall a consistently amusing sitcom that mixes imaginative touches with down-to-earth tales of growing up to good effect. Mostly it avoids sentimentality and this is to its benefit because it takes away the bad taste that I often got with stuff like Friends etc. The cast are roundly good and the material is consistently funny and engaging.

As a teenager (played by Tyler James Williams), Chris is the only black student at Corleone Junior High School and is also its most hated student.

I had a feeling they were going to find out about it. He's lucky he didn't get whipped. Plus, when he got a dog, I liked the part when he was training it and trying to get the attack out of him. That part reminded me of Mulan when she was going to war. She still kicks butt up to this day. Anyways, I didn't like the way that episode ended. When Blackie wanted to attack Chris, he didn't know enough Spanish to avoid being attacked. Personally, he should have gotten a rottweiler since it understands English.

So far, two other episodes I like are when Chris and Drew skipped school so Drew could meet Wayne Gretsky and when Chris called in a bomb threat when there wasn't going to be one. It was similar to crying wolf because in the end, someone cried wolf for real and no one came to help. In other words, when someone called in a bomb threat for real, no one came to help. As a results, the school got blown up. Now, the kids have nowhere to go during the day until their parents enroll them somewhere else. Plus, the ending on Everybody Hates Gretsky was funny. When Chris and Drew got out of the limo, their parents were furious, especially their mother. They were getting whipped big time. Dead Boys walking. Picture both of them having difficulties walking.

You can predict exactly what's going to happen.<br/><br/>Even if you strip that you're left with a poor submarine movie. The lighting is very awkward compared to the 80s movie making the interior scenes appear dark and washed. But the most annoying is the lack of historical accuracy. One example is how, every time they run into a contact the torpedo guys immediately start flooding the tubes and open the doors, without waiting for the captain to order it.<br/><br/>Ironically that's not even what pissed me off the most.

I used to think that with the exception of the rare gem, it was all Rosamunde Pilcher, Traumschiff and Tatort. I always bemoaned the fact that we have so many talented actors, directors and writers and so much crap came out of it and in the end the most celebrated German films are movies starring actors with the syllable \"Schweig\" in their last name. Ironic, because that is really what they should have done.\nBut then over the last few years there have been a few exceptions in my mind, which were not great, but interesting and most importantly: watchable. I would name Dark, Deutschland 83, 4Blocks, Babylon Berlin and even the recent Dogs of Berlin. So now I was reasonably excited to see a remake of Das Boot, which is what this was marketed as. In the end, in my book it's a mess and no more than four out of ten. I watched all of it, but am not sure if I should have. Anyone who rated this 10 out of 10 is an idiot or a Sky shill, but it's not a one or two out of ten piece of crap, either.<br/><br/>The Good:\nThe period setting is really quite well done. They did excellent on using La Rochelle and recreating the base. All this is really solid.\nThe camera work is also very well done. The fact that the claustrophobia of the boat does not really come across is an editing problem, the camera-work is solid.\nSome of the acting is really quite good. At times it is frustrating to see that some of the actors are given terrible lines to work with at other times, the acting is simply all over the place, this is true in particular for Vicky Krieps. Some scenes are wonderfully done, others downright terrible.<br/><br/>The Bad:\nThe storyline is a mess. It's absolutely clear that they started out not with a story that they needed to tell, but with eight hour-long episodes to fill with content. Why exactly did we need the Resistance plot? Was it really only to get two female leads? So much of it feels like people were just trying to fill the episode and there's never a sense of a drive towards a climax. If there is a climax, you never get a sense of what it might be, there is no build-up. Plot-arcs are commenced and ended throughout. Where are we going, nobody knows?\nThe characters all feel like people we've seen too many times before: The die-hard, stubborn rebel, the dashing American rogue, the noble bad guy, the conflicted collaborating French policeman.... Move along folks, nothing new to see here. None of this feels like original content and this has nothing to do with the fact that it's marketed as a remake.\nThe language decisions in this film are terrible. In true Rosamunde Pilcher style, the language is all German and we're simply supposed to imagine they're speaking French or English (and at times it really leaves you wondering whether this is a moment where you're supposed to be imagining they're speaking French or not). Didn't these guys learn anything from all the recent sub-titled shows. Go watch Narcos, dangit. Where's Hans Landa when you need him!<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The character motivations feel out of place. What was the mutiny on the boat about. What was Tennstedt trying to accomplish? First, he's a rule-stickling, by-the-book Nazi, then he can't wait to disobey orders and head a mutiny for some glory he must realize he can never get by pursuing this course. It doesn't make sense. The same with Wrangel and the crew.\nThis show is a social justice warrior's dream. I don't have a problem with any plot point that comes up, if it fits the story and makes sense in the place it is given, but this??? In a show about a WWII sub you have two female leads, the main lead is Lesbian, the men are ALL rapists, the NAZIS are all fully-in-line, obedient fascists. A lot of it feels like it's simply ticking the boxes of political correctness.\nAnd then there's the historical inaccuracies. As a German, I don't have a problem with calling a spade a spade, when it comes to the Third Reich, but when there is so much actual terrible historical material to work with, why would you have to make up stuff and exaggerate? A gang-rape and killing of a barmaid by soldiers would certainly not have gone down the way it did, even if the authorities did not know that this was the spouse and mother of the child of a fellow German soldier. Even if it were just to keep the townsfolk content, there would have been a harsh punishment. And then the reprisals: Yes, there were German reprisals against resistance activity and hostages were taken and shot, but these were people already imprisoned for suspected resistance activity or for being communists. This is quite bad enough, but in my mind a whole lot different from just randomly and knowingly selecting innocent townsfolk to be shot. There were massacres, like the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre, but this was after D-Day and the product of open hostility from the French populace and the panicked and desperate attempts of the occupying force to keep control. Again, a very different scenario. This feels like \"Atonement\" where they just threw in an orphanage that was entirely massacred, just for the heck of it, because that is what Nazis do.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a bad-to-mediocre show that has no sense of perspective or drive. It's just an attempt to cash in using a big name and ticking all the boxes.

This show shares some of the DNA with the aforementioned property (most noticeably parts of the iconic soundtrack) but it's really its own thing. It may have been financially prudent to attach the show to the well-established brand because it helped sell it around the world but I feel like the inevitable backlash this always creates when certain expectations are raised and subsequently disappointed may have done more harm than good, as evidenced by most of the user reviews on here so far.<br/><br/>Second of all: I have seen the whole first season, all 8 episodes. Therefore, I think I can fairly judge whether it's a failure or not. I think that overall, the season is a success; however, I thought that the second half of the season was much stronger than the first and really brought everything together. If I had rated the show after having watched only a few episodes, I would have rated it lower. But I still liked it well enough to continue watching it and I'm glad that I did.<br/><br/>Now on to the review:<br/><br/>The show is well-produced. Lookwise, it has a touch of blandness and cleanliness in the early episodes that seems a bit too sterile and not lived-in enough for my taste but I still vastly prefer this over the ridiculously color-graded period drama look of some other contemporary productions. The grittiness increases with the plot and I like that not everyone's covered in grime and sweat right from the start but only when it makes sense due to the situation. The beards also grow exponentially ;)<br/><br/>The acting is a bit stilted in the beginning and the writing a bit forced (especially the parts with the vulgar dialogue) but this improves as the show goes on and by the end I had a great appreciation for the large cast (yes, the characters are a bit indistinguishable at first but you'd be hard-pressed not to be able to tell the difference after a few episodes). As always, there are some stronger actors and some weaker ones but I don't think there's a true weak spot here.<br/><br/>As for the direction: It was the best part in my opinion. It really elevated the writing and managed to bring a lot of inner turmoil of the characters to the surface. Then again, I'm a fan of Andreas Prochaska's work, full disclaimer, guilty as charged.<br/><br/>I will agree with those who say that having two parallel storylines on the land and on the submarine might not have been the smartest decision because it splits the attention of the viewer and most will find themselves wishing that the show would switch back to the other storyline, depending on their preference. I, for one, really enjoyed both storylines, however, and thought that they were well-balanced. In the first half of the season, I enjoyed the resistance storyline more and in the second half, I enjoyed the submarine storyline more, but both managed to add up to a bigger picture in the end.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure how to sum up how I feel about the show because there's a lot of heavy stuff in it. More than with any other show I've watched in recent memory, it felt very mature and adult in its content and themes. Don't be fooled by the people saying that this is a soap opera. I'd be surprised if anyone called this a soap opera after having watched it all through to the end. There are personal conflicts, of course, but none of them resolve in a remotely cheesy way. If anything, I'd call the conflict solving on this show brutal.<br/><br/>One last thing: I watched the show without a dub and really enjoyed the realism of having the characters speak in the languages they would have realistically communicated in in their respective situations. I also enjoyed seeing such an international cast and was particularly impressed with the French actors.<br/><br/>In any case, I liked the show, even if I found some of the scenes in the later episodes hard to stomach, and I'm glad it was renewed for a second season.", "rating": null, "helpful": "95 out of 155 found this helpful.", "date": "7 December 2018"}, {"title": " What a disappointment", "content": "I am a huge fan of the original Das Boot series and the film also so my expectations were very high when I heard about this new series.

The plane shoots at the boot (but does not drop bombs for no logical reason), while everyone rushes inside.

Suddenly, there is an destroyer! I mean literally 10 seconds after the emergency dive! What the?!? That would mean, the destroyer would have some kind of cloaking device or travels at lightspeed cause otherwise the crew would HAVE SEEN it an HOUR AGO. Whatever. it goes on: The sonar-crewman screams histerically \"Wasserbomben\". Riiight. The chance of hearing the splash of bombs was minimal, but at least possible, as survivors recalled. So, what next? In the moment of dropping waterbombs, a destroyer speeds up to full speed, to avoid being damaged by the wake of detonating bombs. This is THE only moment where the destroyers can not use their sonar or ASDIC equipments. This very moment every Boot used the opportunity to break the silence and go to full speed ahead also. Guess what happens here? Frightened faces, clinging to metal pipes... And nothing. They wait to die basically. Next thing we see are hollywoodeske explosions directly above, neyt and below the Boot. *Facepalm* A bomb exploding a 40 meters away was fatal. NOTHING makes any sense here.

And it seems to continue on a crash-dive all the way until we are finally released at the end of Episode 8.

There are small mercies.<br/><br/>And yet the first two episodes of Series One set an interesting scene, everything looked authentic, and the claustrophobia of the submarine came across. At first it also seemed interesting to include the shore-based support staff, and I thought the idea of portraying the dilemma of ethnic Germans born in Alsace, and now brought \"heim ins Reich\" was something you don't often see.<br/><br/>I wasn't too sure about the Gestapo officer. He seemed remarkably nice in those first two episodes and then remarkably unobservant of what surely must have been questionable, if not obvious and suspicious behaviours by the principal female character.<br/><br/>And the production really started taking on water in the next two episodes. The U-boat crew are redirected on a secret mission. OK. Back at base, the German Alsatian heroine actually meets a local resistance leader and does nothing? I could just about accept that until the two got into bed together by the end of that double episode. Now based on everything that's come so far, was that about the most unpredicted and unbelievable plot turn you could ever think of? It was for me. And why would it end this way? Who knows? There was no apparent logic in it from the story. I suspect a major consideration was the opportunity to show some bare female skin, (as is surely obligatory in any European production that the Sky organisation has a hand in anyway).<br/><br/>Episodes 5 and 6 just started getting ridiculous. Right, there was the obligatory bare breast scene which presumably was the point of the lesbian affaire. The Gestapo officer started putting two and two together and it added up to 2.2.

And on the boat things start to go badly for the now very unpopular commander, the subject of all manner of nasty rumours.<br/><br/>In the last two episodes, we learn that Simone was happy to betray her newly minted fatherland because she had found the love of her life in the female head of the Resistance, Monroe.

It is also very relevant in today's India with its tense social and religious under-current. <br/><br/>Every actor is top-notch. The role is Bread &amp; Butter for Nawazuddin Siddiqui and he owns every scene he is in. How badly I wanted Saif Ali Khan to prove himself once more after 'Langda Tyagi'. He is not only superb but you feel the amount of efforts he has put in the role. Also the actor playing 'Bunty Sharma' is the best among all the sub-characters.<br/><br/>The series is truly Binge-worthy and shows what can be achieved without the CBFC 'Big Brother' role. I am however quite sceptic of how it would be received by majority of the Indian audience who have been spoiled with mushy romantic genres and action for them is a muscular middle aged guy beating up 30 under-fed rowdies.

This isn't a slow narrative, you basically have to run with the characters to catch up with their mind and emotions and sometimes have to see between the frames. I live on the extreme ends of storytelling arch. I love the slow narrative where each and everything is described in such a manner that you feel you are in that situation and you start feeling what the character feels and then there is the impromptu situation where you are unexpectedly put in and you have to start catching up with why the characters are doing what they are doing. Both are fun ways to sit back and enjoy a show. Sacred Games falls under the latter category.\nGanesh Gaitonde is that don who has only one purpose and that is to be the city he lives in - Bombay. The show takes us through his journey from Trimbakeshwar to Bombay and how as an adult after pedaling in drugs he decides by and by that he is meant for much more than that. He dreams big and he sets his ambition into action. We see ruthlessness in him which is a pre requisite of being a don but at the same time we see him trying to make his gang walk the secular line so as not to have religion come into play. You and I and that is if you were born in the 80's will nod your head at the narrative of the story when scenes of unrest are shown in the post Indira Gandhi era that has left the nation broken and at the same time has become that \"gap\" that Politicians use as their mosh pits come election season.<br/><br/>Gaitonde claims he has three fathers and tells us about each one and how they influenced his life and made him who he is.\nThen we have Sartaj, the Sikh inspector who is trying really hard to battle the internal corruption in police services by refusing to give a false statement in court. His refusal becomes leverage for his superior who dangles his refusal as bait at every opportunity that Sartaj needs back up or when he works on a lead.\nSartaj has his own emotional baggage. His wife has left him and he hasn't gotten over her. This I presume is what leads him to consume anxiety pills. We see a little bit of emotional instability in him but not so much that we question his judgment as he pursues his cop instincts.\nAnjali Mathur, the RAW agent who wants to step out into the field and not just stay behind her desk. She, like Sartaj, follows her instincts and teams up with Sartaj to save the city. Except she believes there is more to the story than just a gang war. Of course she is stopped from acting on her hunch and evidence because hey she's a girl and girls can't go out and play after sundown. Like Sartaj she also has her own reasons for being who she is and that is what propels her into going forward to uncover the roles of different people in the story.\nKookoo, I think was a metaphor for the city itself and whoever had Kookoo had Bombay. That's all that I'll be saying about this character.<br/><br/>These are the primary characters and these characters all have very obvious roles to play and are definitely the leads but for me it was the secondary actors who did all the work in making me hate and love the plot.\nKanta Bai, who is so freaking stoic even when there is chaos around her and even when things are going bad she is just there strong as a pillar and not scared of Gaitonde. Probably because she is more like a mother to him, after all it's all thanks to her that he gets his first break.\nKatekar, is that constable who is at Sartaj's beck and call. Even though he represents the constable in the series he is also doing the added job of being the common man's voice when he is expressing his opinions as a person. Most of us have skewed perspectives based on the news and political speeches we are fed.\nMalcolm Murad, was a decently surprising character. I liked him in entirety except in one place when he did something out of character.\nDCP Parulkar's character has been portrayed so well! He makes you hate him. He makes you want to plough through his body with a rain of bullets. I like it when actors actually make you believe they are really that bad.<br/><br/>The dialogues are amazing, even the ones making a jibe at political situations. Don't know who Shah Bano is?

I can safely say that most were adequately met, even exceeded. <br/><br/>While admittedly the story has nothing new to offer, this Bombay gangster series is stylishly shot and executed with finesse. Bombay becomes a character in the series and the chasm between the classes which is so in-your-face in Bombay is captured beautifully. All major cities have class differences but none of them are as stark and apparent as they in Bombay. I was also happy to see it called by its old name of \"Bombay\" in English and \"Bambai\" in Hindi -felt authentic. <br/><br/>The story itself is a cat and mouse game involving a variety of characters - mob bosses, religious figures, a gender-neutral character, corrupt cops, the inevitable honest cop, a female cop from a central police agency. While stereotypes are rift, there some funny touches. The nick names given by the female CBI officer to store numbers on her cell is an example as is the track of the police constable trying to get an intimate moment with his nagging wife. <br/><br/>The ending leaves plenty of scope for a sequel - I do not wish to get into spoilers but what is a thoroughly satisfying series seems subject to an abrupt end. <br/><br/>Saif Ali Khan is top notch and quite unlike an Indian hero for he keeps getting beaten up with alarming regularity but his character is the moral compass of the show. Nawazuddin predictably owns every scene he is in - it is an extension of his character from Gangs of Wasseypur. How you miss Manoj Bajpai though. <br/><br/>A great thing about Anurag Kashyap is that he is able to find character actors who leave such a strong impression on the screen. And \"Sacred Games\" is no different.\nAll the character actors are uniformly excellent. <br/><br/>I tried listening to the track in English and it is atrocious. Not only does it take away from the authenticity of the proceedings, it is also badly dubbed. Imagine watching Narcos in English.

And while the costume leaves a lot to be desired, Peter Serafinowicz's Tick (which is just a lovely Adam West impersonation - right down to the use of \"chum\") - he is as big and clunk headed as he should be. The addition of a more \"realistic\" storyline for Arthur I think works; and would give the series legs if it is picked up. I would love to see more of this.<br/><br/>And the casting of Arthur could not be more spot on. The actor plays the serious parts and the comic foil equally well.<br/><br/>The humor is the same. It has a small touch of sincerity which the original and the 2000s live action didn't need nor would have benefited from. But the one-off joke of superheros in a superhero-jaded world has been done.

I have only a basic account, so will end up paying for future episodes if any. While not perfect, it shows promise. I did like the delivery of lines by Peter Serafinowicz as the title character, but he lacks the threatening presence of Patrick Warburton. I was OK with the Arthur backstory, but don't think it really added anything. Griffin Newman very nearly nailed Arthur, I think.<br/><br/>I did not like The Tick's costume. It looked cheap and cheesy. Was this intentional or were there budget constraints? Significant muscle padding may have been an improvement, since Serafinowicz's frame is not particularly imposing as I note previously. Another criticism I had was that the show is not over-the-top enough. It's like an awkward merging of life as we know it with the absurd, and they just don't \"fit\". I cannot imagine the plethora of ridiculous Tick characters in this universe, and I would miss that. I don't expect Chairface Chippendale or even The Human Ton &amp; Handy to make appearances due to the apparent effort to make this series more \"realistic.\" <br/><br/>That said, I think the program has considerable potential.

I too held off from watching this latest incarnation for fear of being let down. I finally cracked the ice last night and ended up binge watching the entire first season. A disappointment it is not.<br/><br/>That out of the way, it is important to clarify this latest iteration of The Tick is not just a rehash/recreation of previous series. Many of the same characters are present but the overall tone is darker and more 'real' and less straight up silly and cartoonish. Whether that is good or bad will depend on how much you are insistent that this iteration duplicate what the prior series had already done.<br/><br/>I was not overtly impressed by the first couple episodes. The need to explain Arthur's neurosis as the product of a deeply traumatic event seemed heavy handed and largely unnecessary. The first two episodes really lag because of this burden. But once Arthur's obsessions are established and validated and the crew is set on their purpose, the relevance of that heavy origin story gets mostly shoved to the back and the episodes get MUCH better.<br/><br/>At this point we get introduced to the wonderful cast and can immerse ourselves in the overall great production. Most all the performances are top notch, with a special shout out to Haley as the Terror, though my favorite character hands down is Ms. Lint. Such an inspired bit of writing to introduce the down side to a super power. Martinez plays the role with such nuance. Many of the characters walk a moralistic middle ground but none so sharply as Ms. Lint and I delighted in every scene was in.<br/><br/>Oddly, the only real disappointment for me, albeit a minor one, is the Tick himself. Serafinowicz tackles the role well enough but I still can't help but feel he's not quite right in the part. But even more to the point, it is odd to find the titular character so subordinate in this series to be almost irrelevant. The series is clearly centered around Arthur and quite frankly Overkill could easily fill the roll of protecting Arthur. That doesn't mean The Tick isn't enjoyable when on screen; he is. But the focus of the series is clearly moved away from him and the overall tone shifted as to make The Tick's own bizarre existence seem almost out of place. The Tick's origin is only briefly touched upon, then sidelined even further back than Arthur's.<br/><br/>Many have commented on the darker tone in this series and yes, that is a noticeable difference. However, the humor is still there though it too is often dark and much less cartoonish than one might expect. The series is also considerably more mature than previous iterations; this is not for the kiddies despite visual appearances. Indeed, the show can get quite graphic or vulgar in an instant and it's not hard to imagine that Amazon was inundated with angry letters from parents who had to explain four letter words or slashed throats to their confused eight years olds. It's almost a certainty that is why the series was cancelled. A real shame too, because this iteration of the Tick was really well done; as good as any of the previous iterations despite all its differences.
