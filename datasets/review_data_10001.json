Built up as a super villain who radiates domination, he instead turned out to be a harmless rocker who switches between \"nice uncle from next door\" to \"bat swinging psycho killer\" whenever the script demands it.<br/><br/>Negan was supposed to surpass the Governour in terms of cruelty and malice, but in my opinion he doesn't even get close. The Governour had charisma, style, and above all, a real reason for all his experiments; his daughter. We still don't know why or how Negan came to be.<br/><br/>Season 6 was full of chest-pounding and inevitably doomed plotting by the heroes, but it was still fun to watch them descend into mass murder. Especially Carol had incredibly intense moments.<br/><br/>Season 7, after the reveal of Negan, turned out to be a super slow recuperation with the nice uncle coming over for spaghetti. They tried to show how he controls his people with rules and by burning them and so on, but overall it was a super tame story with \"Soon(TM)\" all over it.<br/><br/>Instead of fixing that in season 8, they now bury the show in one action episode after another. And its not the somewhat smart action we saw in earlier seasons, but 80's style A-Team nonsense action. Cars are bullet sponges, ammo is thrown around like its World War II, a .50 caliber machine gun mows down 50 people with ease but can't hit one dude in a Jeep, and there is no stopping to all the shooting. Even when people are having a quiet moment to talk, you hear often hear shooting in the background.<br/><br/>We rarely have those epic Daryl moments anymore, Rick has become a a hollow shell of a leader, Carl seems to be on vacation.

Its hard to pin-point one thing that is extraordinary about Season 1 since there are so many aspects to talk about. First off, the scenes in downtown Atlanta were incredibly visual and the scenes that took place in more rural areas were very scenic. The undead in the first season had great makeup and special effects too, the zombies had defined faces that really make them feel they were once human. If I had to pick one thing that was great about the first season, its has to be the cast... Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal make great, bad ass lead actors that also have the ability to project a range of emotions. Laurie Holden is also radiant in this season and the surrounding cast of Jeffrey DeMunn, Steven Yeun, Irone Singleton, and Norman Reedus all showcase a great character that can be easily become a fan-favorite to any.

Like an aging boxer this show doesn't really know where to go and what to do anymore. So it keeps trying to do what it did in its youth but to lesser effect. Is it time to hang up those gloves?<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with the story 'TWD' is about a group of people trying survive a zombie apocalypse.\nIt soon becomes apparent that you should fear the dead but fear the living even more.\nIt's dog eat dog, or in most cases human eating human!\nThe show started out very promising and over its eight seasons developed a bunch of characters that you will truly begin to care.\nUnfortunately the show seems to have lost its way and has become almost as clumsy as the dithering dead that walk the Earth.\nDuring the shows entire run ( I'm currently watching season eight as I write this) there has been some truly magnificent television. Some great storytelling, nail biting, riveting moments that shock and keep the audience hooked.<br/><br/>Characters come and go and the long run time of each season helps us get to know each individual thoroughly. The cast become almost like family members. So when one of them does meet their demise it's upsetting. There's been some great villains and foes along the way too. The Governor and Negan being most memorable. Negan played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan is probably the best thing about the more recent seasons. There's characters that have conflicting views. Shane played by Jon Bernthal being a good example. This show tugs on all the emotions. There's pain, anger, fear and despair. There's also the well timed piece of humour here and there to show that despite all that has happened to them these people are still human.<br/><br/>The production value of this show is of very high quality. Only the odd piece of CGI occasionally lets the side down. Particularly the CGI flames used instead of practical effects. This is odd as the practical and makeup effects in this show are second only to Game of Thrones. Prosthetic makeup effects are Oscar worthy.\nCan a TV show get an Oscar?\nI don't know but if it can this show definitely should get one.\nZombies are brought to life, if that makes any sense by some truly wonderful makeup design. Animatronics are very realistic giving the whole show a level of authenticity usually associated with a high budget Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>One criticism I do have is that the show doesn't look and sound as good as it should. As a High definition experience the picture is often grainy with no vibrancy. Possibly this is intentional to show the grubby broken down world that the show is set in.\nSound doesn't seem to immerse as well as it should. While I'll admit that it isn't bad, it just doesn't sound as involving as some other big budget TV shows. Overall 'TWD' is a superb show. One that will go down as a classic.

I LOVE zombie movies. Dawn of The Dead is my favorite. Back in the early 2000 there were several great zombie movies. Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling \u0085 suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as \"action\" movie. No one would tell the difference.<br/><br/>Right now you cannot care about any character. Bad actors that play as much as the trees in the background die by the dozen by each episode. Flashbacks and \"emotional\" (dumb) dialogues want to make us care about someone. But you can't. Zombies do not matter anymore, only rarely when they suddenly matter. It is either this image of them as \"pests\" most of the time, or lethal killers out of a sudden. I am sick of watching a cheap action movie that has nothing to do with a zombie movie. A zombie movie was a zombie movie because of the thriller surrounding this worldwide catastrophe of people turning into these creepy and horror things. That was the MAIN factor. TWD has nothing to do with that anymore.<br/><br/>If TWD would have kept 4-5 main characters and presented their struggle to live in this horror world full of zombies, then that could have been a great series. But even that has to stop. The only reason TWD continues is money. That's all. They make more money off the show. Why do you think the action happens in forests and zombies are mainly seen in packs from distance? Because it is cheap. No need to pay for shooting in a town and pay for complex CGI, a forest is perfect.<br/><br/>So. I loved this series but now I think it is the cheapest garbage out there. Honestly I don't care what happens anymore so I'll finally give up. Last episode \"Some Guy\" did it for me. I just could not bare anymore.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. However, that being said I have to disagree with the reviewer.<br/><br/>So here are the reasons I like the show.<br/><br/>First, character development, this is not usually a very big trait in the Zombie genre. If you only watched 3 episodes, this is a big part of what you watched. They take the time to give you a slight background of the characters, a chance for you to get to know them. For those of us that are big fans of the Zombie genre it gave us a chance to think \"Who would I be?\" in this situation.<br/><br/>Second, the story doesn't follow a straight line. This was a point of contention in the other review. I personally like the multiple story lines. It keeps things interesting and keeps it from becoming a boring show where I can foresee how everything is going to turn out. And before anyone says it\u0085YES I know this is based off a graphic novel. I haven't read it and will refrain from reading it for a while.<br/><br/>Third, the zombies look and act pretty bad ass. The make up is done great, not a bunch of CGI which is so common in today's world. So anyway\u0085if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre to begin with then yeah, you probably aren't going to get why so many of us love the show. However, I think most fans of the genre will love this show. <br/><br/>So in closing, for those of us who love the genre, It's a weekly dose of zombie apocalypse. <br/><br/>For those that aren't fans of the genre, when the zombie apocalypse happens and you don't know what to do\u0085don't come crying to me and my friends\u0085you'll just slow us down.<br/><br/>On second thought\u0085you may come in handy in case we need to make a hasty retreat", "rating": null, "helpful": "449 out of 710 found this helpful.", "date": "7 August 2011"}, {"title": " Smell of decay grows stronger in S10.", "content": "Someone cancel this show.

It just sort of screams in your face \"Love me!\" with all its interesting characters who are very different from each other and a nice plot that you just have to be addicted to. The supporting work is clearly a winner. It has a very lovable supporting cast with T.R. Knight as the sweet and sort of the \"average guy\" as George O'Malley and Katherine Heigl who is very likable in her role - even Sandra Oh is a clear winner on top. And my personal favorite is \"the Nazi\" - Dr. Miranda Bailey who is played by Chandra Wilson. Very, very well done.<br/><br/>This is sort of a soapy spin on \"Scrubs\" and \"ER\" but with light comedy/romance and serious and intense drama where character build up the plot. Some of the characters may get a bit annoying for your taste (ex. Meredith Grey) but the acting is just superb and you can't help liking it. It has a guilty-pleasure feel to it and you just can't help but stay up late for this show. This show is definitely not about \"medicine\" - when it has to deal with medicine, it has a clear soft side to it. The doctors play heroes (pretty clich\u00e9d, but yeah - this IS a hospital show) and save lives or care or has to live up to certain defeat. Just to be aware: This is a show about relationships-within-a-hospital and the life of each person that works there.<br/><br/>The show breaks all the \"bad\" mid-season shows record.

We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. <br/><br/>From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. <br/><br/>For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy \"jumped the shark.\" <br/><br/>Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple \"sexual\" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. <br/><br/>While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. <br/><br/>With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show.

Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>We were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.<br/><br/>BUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.<br/><br/>Killing off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson &amp; April's baby!! WHAT!! Too much!<br/><br/>So my personal opinion of this series is, I'm hooked, I have to see it through, but I recommend not watching after midway through the 9th season, its a waste of time and will likely only annoy. I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone....

I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. It was actually laughable. Needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage. Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout.

The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.<br/><br/>When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow &amp; move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.<br/><br/>Season 6 &amp; 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books &amp; George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.<br/><br/>This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.<br/><br/>Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan &amp; Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.<br/><br/>The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'.

I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.<br/><br/>While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.<br/><br/>Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.<br/><br/>All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>After watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.<br/><br/>In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).<br/><br/>Top form, HBO.

Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. <br/><br/>I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. <br/><br/>If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. <br/><br/>Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend.

Cable has provided some great options but we were running out of things to watch so we started searching out for TV shows from other countries. What we have found is many of the dramas from places like England, Ireland and even Iceland are very well thought out with intricate stories.\nThis show is one of the best I have ever watched regardless of where it is produced. There is some action but this show really shines in two areas.The first is the stories. They are very well conceived. One thing we noticed when watching the show was the gray areas with all of the characters. I think one of the themes of this show is not to see people in terms of good and bad with no in between. That everything is not black and white and that human beings are more complex than many TV shows portray them to be.\nFor people who enjoy shows like NYPD Blue or Bosch, this is in that same category.\nThe second area that shines with this show is the acting. These actors offer a broad range well beyond what you might normally see in TV shows. Great actors from series like NYPD Blue (Dennis Franz) or The Americans (Matthew Rhys) are part of what made those shows so compelling and here there are so many standout performances I don't know where to begin. They are simply fantastic.\nAnyway, if you are tired of watching junk check out this show.

Gripping from the start, it never really let go and even if the conclusion was slightly unsatisfactory in my eyes, in that pretty much all the bad guys got away with it and justice wasn't seen to be done, but in terms of plotting and character development, it was riveting throughout.<br/><br/>The subject of police corruption and the workings of the internal affairs unit has to be handled sensitively but realistically and here I was convinced from the outset. What made it more interesting and watchable was that the central character under investigation, DCI Tony Gates is presented to us as an award-winning cop, a family man who even stops crime on his time-off, foiling a petty robbery at a restaurant where he's eating in the first episode. Unfortunately in so doing, he absent-mindedly allows the restaurant to not take payment for his meal (in this day and age, it's an offence for the police to accept gratuities, even when off-duty) and worse, he's in the company of his lover, rich girl lawyer Jacqui, both of which come back to haunt him as he becomes the subject of an investigation for 'laddering\", the practice of only solving easy crimes and getting multiple offences tagged onto the crime sheet, thus boosting his efficiency figures.<br/><br/>Things get far deeper and murkier from there as Gates finds himself at the mercy and under the control of an underworld kingpin, only heard in the first four episodes by his rasping Glasgow accent, messages passed to him on disposable mobile phones by a tear-away ten year old boy, who later participates in a particularly disturbing torture sequence involving Gates' investigating nemesis D.S. Arnott.<br/><br/>The direction was excellent throughout, involving and exciting, with the ensemble acting likewise of the highest order. I wasn't quite convinced, as I wasn't in the otherwise excellent \"The Forsyte Saga\" remake some years ago by Gina McKee as a femme fatale, but in particular Martin Compston and Vicky McClure as the pursuing investigators, the latter undercover, made for an effective team, with thankfully not a whiff of romance in sight between them. As Gates, Lennie James played a difficult part, engaging the viewer's sympathy and anger by turns, before making the ultimate sacrifice at the end.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Compston and McClure reunite to fight more corruption, along with Adrian Dunbar as their wily boss pulling the strings behind them and hope the series did well enough for more episodes to come.

Anti-corruption units, and undercover agents, have been on our screen before ('Between the Lines' - there's clearly something magnetic about that word 'line' and 'The Ghost Squad') - and some of the conspiracy elements seem both far fetched and perfunctory. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Lennie James' protagonist is a hard man to connect with: an almost-clean copper brought down by a bad friend, he remains a hard man to like, and while he appears to be driven by his own private sense of ethics, this moral code seems completely self-centred - he's torn when he fails to live up to his own expectations of himself, but it's hard to see why we should care. And the portrait of feral kids on the local housing estate seems both lazy, and again relatively loosely connected to the more serious crime in the background - if you're looking for the forensic detail of 'The Wire', you won't find it here.

No one is perfect, including the investigated and the investigators.<br/><br/>The standard of casting and acting, as is typical with most UK productions of this kind, is of a high caliber. The convincing characterizations and the tension that mounts for the viewer, as the lives of often good people, who makes bad decisions, slowly unravel, is not always easy to watch. <br/><br/>This is an engaging series, that works well.It keeps the viewers attention with storyline(s) that are, for the most part, believable. Often focusing on personal issues, that make their way into the workplace, as is so often the case, in real life. <br/><br/>Where this series falls down somewhat, is some of the more implausible mistakes made by seasoned police officers. A ring from a glass left on a table, for example, taken by a compromised officer is inexplicable. As is, false claims, regarding a relationship, whilst knowing full well, that text records from mobiles, including intimate ones, are readily available. Any experienced detective would realize, in some instances, truth is less damaging than lies and may, in fact, better hide a bigger lie. <br/><br/>The other shortfall, is how cold and often, unlikable, a good portion of the characters are. Injecting a little human warmth, into this series, would actually increase the impact on the viewer, when things turn sour. This, I think, is what stops Line of Duty from being an exceptional series, like the much loved, classic detective series, in the same vein, Cracker. Cracker is outstanding because it takes far more emotional and personal risks, with its characterizations. <br/><br/>That said, for the most part, Line of Duty is a good series and still represents an intelligent, worthwhile watch.

Really has been an incredible start to this anime, and that is what I have rated it on, though I have extremely high confidence this one will be one that gets better and better.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "179 out of 215 found this helpful.", "date": "18 May 2013"}, {"title": " A Classic in the making,has a great story and fantastic character development- one of the best anime's of 2013", "content": "Although there are already a few reviews on this series, AOT is so good that I still felt the need to write a review.<br/><br/>Attack on Titan is, at the time of this writing, only 8 episodes into the series, yet it already seems to be one of the best anime of 2013. I'm a big fan of SAO and this series is right on par with part 1 of SAO (if you're reading this and Haven't seen Sword Art Online, I would very highly recommend it- definitely one of the best anime I've ever seen.)<br/><br/>**Here's a quick note- if you aren't sure whether or not you'll want to watch this, here are some things that could keep you away. There IS gore in AOT, and while it lessens up later, the first few episodes are particularly gruesome compared to shows like Naruto or One Piece. If you're interested but not big on the gore, try watching Psycho Pass. It's a great anime in its own right but it's also not afraid of some blood. If that show has too much Gore for you then you probably won't like AOT. Also, if you get scared easily, these Titans are extremely creepy. Like, Evil-Clown level creepy. In the end, wouldn't recommend for early teens.**<br/><br/>Some reviews have given confusing accounts of what Attack on Titan is about (I'm looking at you blackmamba99971) whereas others have given much more concise sums (fanis-gav has a good one) but basically, it's a Medieval-looking time period and humanity lives in the spaces between 3 separate circular walls (Great Wall of China sized walls) one inside of the next. These walls were put up to protect humanity from the Titans, humanoids with no \"junk\" that go in sizes of 5, 7, 15, and 60 meters (A tall human is 2 meters by the way). No-one knows where the titans came from or how they survive/reproduce or even how they can be killed for awhile. All they know is that Titans eat humans simply because they enjoy it. After \"100 years of peace\" living within the walls, the Titans break through a part of the Outermost wall where a young boy named Eren lives. To put it shortly, he sees some people killed right in front of him and vows to \"wipe out each and every Titan.\"<br/><br/>Now here is where the show really sets itself apart. In most anime, the main character has some secret power or something that allows them to live up to their challenge. Naruto had a ton of chakra, Luffy had the Gum-Gum fruit and Ichigo had an intense Spiritual Pressure. All these MC's have something exceptional about them that makes anything seem possible.<br/><br/>This is anything but the case for Eren. When we meet Eren, he's a scrawny little punk that can't even take on others his age, much less an adult or Titan. The idea of Eren taking on a few of the lower level Titans is laughable. Even after a 5 year time-skip where Eren and other kids have become young adults trained to kill Titans with the Recon squad (a unit of the Army that goes outside the walls to fight Titans and has little to no success at this point), they look like as big a threat to Titans as a toddler with a wooden gun. And you see it in every episode too; the feeling that no-one is safe and the desperate plight that the characters are in really permeates the entire show. There's no \"Last-Second-Save\" like in most other anime, and the twists come every week. You get to know a whole cast of characters but you never know who's safe or not. This adds a gravity, a realness to the show that brings you in and really allows you to connect with these all too fragile, human characters.<br/><br/>Besides that, the artwork is fantastic, the soundtrack gets better each episode, the character and plot development is top-notch and there's still a ton of room to grow with where the Titans come from, what Eren's dad injected him with (we still don't know), what's in the basement and how the Colossal Titan keeps appearing. If you can deal with a bit of gore and are looking for a great new show, it's a fantastic piece of work well worth the look.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "223 out of 270 found this helpful.", "date": "26 May 2013"}]}, "/title/tt1586680/": {"title": "Shameless", "reviews": [{"title": " Keep Watching", "content": "I have never watched the British version of this show so I cannot comment on the original.

It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.<br/><br/>Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.<br/><br/>The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.<br/><br/>The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.<br/><br/>No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.<br/><br/>As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.<br/><br/>Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "221 out of 287 found this helpful.", "date": "19 March 2011"}, {"title": " Time to say goodbye", "content": "There was a time when I would have given this show a 10 (or more if allowed.)

I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. \"I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!\"<br/><br/>Once I finished the American series, I gave it about a month to settle in and then started watching the British series. But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.<br/><br/>Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.<br/><br/>So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...<br/><br/>Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???<br/><br/>Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre. <br/><br/>Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.<br/><br/>Kevin: Dead heat.<br/><br/>Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.<br/><br/>Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.<br/><br/>Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him.

I wasn't sold on the characters and the direction seemed directionless. In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life. <br/><br/>While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities. <br/><br/>Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.<br/><br/>In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show.

The comedy that they do attempt with it is the nasty mean-spirited kind of \"humor\" that is not funny, but is simply insults without intelligence attempting to hide behind the mask of comedy.<br/><br/>So unfortunately the series is going down hill at a break-neck pace, and likely nothing is going to save it now, especially with the loss of the central character.

It doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr. Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its appeal?<br/><br/>James Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the crew and the ship as well. In short, his performance is everything that makes this show great and I suspect he's somehow improved the template like performances of his supporting actors over time. The man is just a joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest thing, the difference one actor can make. <br/><br/>Still, I wish that the creators had chosen a different actress to play the part of Elizabeth Keen, the FBI profiler that Red Reddington is inexplicably fond of. Someone like Zoe Saldana would have been brilliant casting and added dimension to the mystery of the Keen-Reddington relationship. And perhaps better casting for that part would have inspired the writers to shape her role more credibly and sent the show into the stratosphere. While Megyn Kelly may be a solid actress, she does not yet have the chops to make something of the oddly inconsistent writing for her role. Too late to change this up now. <br/><br/>I'm hardly the only fan who tunes in to enjoy Spader's performance, marveling at how the dreamy young actor with long blonde hair evolved into this very charming, balding older man who can act his *beep* off.

Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable.

I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. <br/><br/>This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty.

I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. <br/><br/>I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. <br/><br/>As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. <br/><br/>This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much.

Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.<br/><br/>This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. <br/><br/>Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. <br/><br/>Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).<br/><br/>You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"<br/><br/>Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)<br/><br/>A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys.

There is Viking tradition, there are interesting social and cultural differences between Northmen and others, there is vibrant Viking society and mainly, there is Ragnar; cunning Ragnar, who would \"give far more than his eye to acquire knowledge\". He is a man of progress, whose logic and wit wins against rigidity and stupidity. He is the man, who comes up with new ideas and surprises everyone who wants to defeat him. Finally, he is the only one capable of carrying this show and pushing it forward. <br/><br/>The third season is also pretty good, although it had slowed down a little bit, dragging the story slowly around, but who cares when Ragnar is going to raid the Paris whatever the cost! <br/><br/>As much I like the first three seasons, there is one thing that kept bothering me throughout second and the third one especially. Every time Ragnar kills some of his enemies (earl Haraldson, king Horik), he creates some kind of vacuum in the society he is not able to fill. Yes, he becomes earl and than king nominally, but he doesn't quite behave like one! I mean as Haraldson had been an earl, he had counselor Svein for the dirty stuff and his guard, he was a judge (in fact), blessed children etc. and all in all there was a lot of things happening around him in Kattegat. Not so with Ragnar; he is just kind of there, not ruling whatsoever, and sometimes it just feels like anarchy there, which I find not entirely plausible. Additionaly, as I have mentioned, there is a feeling of emptiness because of this, emptiness, which I am not quite able to describe. Maybe it is happening, because the second and third series already follows more story lines and can't concentrate on Vikings more, which is in my eyes a threat for this show.<br/><br/>Season 4 takes the good things from its predecessors - throws them away - and builds on flawed stuff of the first three seasons - which is emptiness, story distraction and fade-away from Ragnar. Starting with the most serious issue - Ragnar, it was perhaps the worst decision in the whole show to screw him up. For the entire season 4a, he feels old and tired, doesn't have any desire to explore and raid, doesn't care for his people and children much, and as if it wasn't already too bad, we have to watch him as he becomes a drug addict. This alone is just enough for me. The writers basically take the character majority of viewers cares about most and flush him into toilet. I know he must die eventually, but instead of seeing him suffering for about 9 hours (!!), it would be better to kill him off at his zenith.<br/><br/>Another issue, that hardly appeared in the first three series - there are many meaningless scenes which just kind of fill the time. Consider the whole Wessex feminist thing with Judith - so much time is wasted on her becoming tough and independent, but I don't see a reason why - this is something suitable for 20th century, not 9th. On the other hand there is not much explanation on key events such as why Rollo gave up on his manhood and turned into french nobleman and loving husband so easily.<br/><br/>The emptiness and anarchy I was talking about is really apparent in season 4. It is no more the king Ragnar and his people or the vibrant society from early seasons, it is a mixture of random characters with no depth being around. Typical ruling day of king Ragnar consists of throwing knives, ignoring everyone, doing crazy stuff and taking drugs in the shack, stalking on the rooftop and making a foreplay with that Chinese girl. Bj\u00f6rn tries to look as serious as possible, which makes his character so flat it makes me wonder about Ragnar's successor's ability to lead the show (I doubt any of the sons is capable of that). Than the whole thing with Erlendur's revenge is wasted, as everybody knows from the start Bj\u00f6rn will not die and Erlendur has even got no plan; when Kalf was still alive, there was a chance to take advantage of it, but now he wants to kill Bj\u00f6rn and then will see what's next, probably.<br/><br/>I totally agree with others that it has become a soap opera. Consider king Finehair's arrival. It peaks at the end of an episode, when he basically says in front of everybody he wants to overthrow Ragnar, but that situation is not expanded in the next episode, which is typical for soap operas. Speaking of new characters, they are very uninteresting, and especially Yidu is a complete waste of time, and besides I find presence of a Chinese in the fjord disturbing, she just shouldn't be there; her only purpose is to be a drug dealer anyway. Then there is lot of uninteresting talking about family, children (everybody is with a child now, hearing this gives me an allergic reaction) and how it is being a father, which is just boring. And I can't help myself, but the families look like projections of 21th western family values - different from earlier seasons where we could see more freedom in sexual life and less sensitivity about children and death. Overall the episodes are too talkative and while basically nothing happens in most episodes, everything must have happened in the last one and it created a big mess, but I will not comment on that.<br/><br/>For me, Vikings end with the season 3 and the 4a just does not exist.

There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord.

How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like.

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.<br/><br/>Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound clich\u00e9 enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.<br/><br/>As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.<br/><br/>This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually.

Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. <br/><br/>The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard.

First of all the acting is the best I've seen in any television show and it remains consistent for every season. Being a fellow brit, I thought the accents where quite good, a little hard to understand sometimes which it would have been at the time period. The only persons accent i have a problem with is the leader of the billy boys, I can't remember his name, his accent was dreadful. Now, season one and two where my personal favourites, the pacing was excellent and knew when it had to speed up and take a break from the action which was so brutal and compliments the show so very well. The characters are were the show shines, the interactions they have between each other are son interesting and entertaining. The dialogue for every season, besides season three which I will get to, is extremely satisfying. The camera work is nothing too exciting but is grounded and works well for the nineteen hundreds were the show takes place. Also, my oh my was the villain great. Every single action he did was so horrid and made me hate the character with all my heart, which is what you want for a show like this. It's all due to the incredible performance by Sam Neill. Somehow the show makes you root for the alcoholic gangster murderers instead of an Irish police officer, it really takes a different perspective from any other television creation. Season three on the other hand was a bit lacklustre. The show tried to grow too fast, the peaky blinders all of a sudden had ten enemies and a hundred different problems to face and it all became a huge mess, sometimes becoming difficult to follow. The show also took a turn towards more buisnessy affairs which I didn't enjoy as much. Besides all this it was still great. Oh yeah, Tom Hardy randomly showing up for a small part was amazing, he's amazing in this show I just wish there was more of him. Season four picks it back up with a simple revenge story, and it works excellently. The villain is pretty simple, nothing too special with an overall bland and clich\u00e9 performance from a-list actor Adrien Brody. Season five is pretty good as well, the start of the season is really strong and has the Shelby family in a feud but the show very quickly forgets about this and moves on to other, more boring things. The very ending is alright, it still makes me want to watch the next season or film whenever it comes out. I realise that I have been quite harsh in this review but the show is really good and has and will inspire plenty of other shows in the future.

Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros?

The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing.

From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.<br/><br/>In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.<br/><br/>The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm.

Thought they make some attempts , but ultimately enjoy themselves being called hostages.\nAlso the robbers have their nice Team meeting every now and then , without being bothered about the hostages that they may run or hurt any of them. Liked the trust factor that was built betweent the two parties.\nAnd lastly they buillt a nice tunnel between the Royal Mint and the professors house.

After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance. <br/><br/>It is pretty easy to understand why.<br/><br/>As the 20th century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more enlightened, civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down of society began to occur. How did this happen? Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest and in which the weakest or not-so-intelligent were culled, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Evolution began not to reward intelligence, but to coddle and save the weakest. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left \"Intelligent Man and Woman\" to become an endangered species. One need not look far within these comments to see that in effect. It's not that hate which is shown in some of these reviews that is killing the world. I think that up to a certain point all of us possess some level of hate. It is not having the mental acuity or aptitude to recognize it within ourselves, and to not let ourselves be led by it. Some of these so-called reviews are downright scary when you stop to think that is the actual mentality of the person who wrote them. One guy decrying interracial couples and gays to the point of not watching a television program that has them. A woman who says this could not happen and in the next paragraph goes on to detail how it could happen, only not as Christianity. Who cares what it is called, if you admit it could happen?<br/><br/>As for this series itself, it is relevant. For now. In this time. More than ever. <br/><br/>Beyond that, it is beautifully filmed and acted. <br/><br/>Do not fall for the negative reviews of those fanatics and zealots who are purposefully trying to bring down the ratings and who are so lost they cannot even practice the very laws of a god they are trying to defend.<br/><br/>This series is a masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "972 out of 1,452 found this helpful.", "date": "29 April 2017"}, {"title": " The Handmaid's Tale-Seaso-1-2-3", "content": "SEASON-1\nA masterpiece! Put feminism aside for a moment, this is a brilliantly told story whether you are watching it for empowerment or just as a leisure activity.

Season One is slow in parts, but each carefully framed shot is purposeful and powerful. There is no holding back in The Handmaid's Tale, and as the story progresses, there are twists and turns that you have never before seen on T.V.\nSEASON-2\nSeason Two of The Handmaid's Tale is the perfect continuation of Season One, yet it comes back even stronger with new, shocking conflicts. Moss, Fiennes, and Strahovski all have incredible chemistry together on screen, and this season, the tension is stronger than ever.

There is nothing in my previous sentence that is not true. Let me type it again. The Handmaid's Tale is a series that presents what could happen were women's rights reverted or taken away. Is it an extreme depiction? Let's study that for a moment. In a Puritanical society, the Bible was the sole authority. Puritans believed it applied to every area and level of life. The Salem Witch Trials are one such example of Puritanical beliefs in action. Were it not for historical documentation, you would have people negating those as well. So, as to the question of whether it could or couldn't happen, the people most decrying it and stating that it could not happen, are the ones that most believe it can.

The other major problem is that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was a masterpiece of understatement and brevity.

Birth rates are plummeting. An ultra religious cult see it as their God given mission to 'save mankind'. They seize power by staging a fake terrorist attack against the US government, impose marshal law and set about rebuilding American society.('War On Terror' anyone?) They use The Old Testament as their blue print, but with some totally wack interpretations and distortions. Fertile women become the property of the state. Brain washed and farmed out to the new ruling elite as baby makers, slavery and subjugation is all they can hope for. <br/><br/>Margaret Atwood, Canadian hero, social commentator, environmentalist, activist, feminist, tech inventor, business woman and visionary always maintained that this isn't sci-fi, but 'speculative fiction', things that have a chance of happening in the near future. Written in the '80's it's probably more profound now; the Neo Con Christian's have become a powerful force in US politics. Could there be a Tea Party without the ultra religious Republicans? Probably not. Maybe it takes a next door neighbour from Canada to really see what's happening with the totally dysfunctional family next door? It has always been a source of debate about how a country so entrenched in the ideas of freedom and liberal philosophy can also be the home of such obvious bigotry and divide? Surely teaching Creationism instead of proved science in some State's schools is a warning sign? Maggie may well ridicule this dogmatic un-thinking, however it's far from funny when she points out the possible end game and consequences for society and women in particular.<br/><br/>The book, although heavy going at first, is one of those you can pick up every few years and just dive right in (thanks to Una for making me read it back in '87). I was worried that this TV adaption wouldn't do it justice. How wrong I was. It's slightly different, and relies on a lot of flashbacks like the original narration; however this narration helps to smooth over the cracks nicely. So it still sticks faithfully to the principles and main events of the story, albeit in a roundabout 'more up to date' way. The subtle creep up and takeover of government and power has been well handled so far. I am enthralled, totally impressed and on tenterhooks with Bruce Miller's adaption. The direction is also smart, (the hanging scene seen from the back of a van was powerful stuff). Every image is a perfect composition, nothing is wasted, it's real art in the hands of skilled camera operators. <br/><br/>The feminism is subtle, not the clumsy and overt 'all men are bad, all women are good little victims' like of some of the more hardcore feminist literature. Maggie recognises that some women can be bad too, and some men will die to do the right thing, as you will see. Her book made a point that this could only happen if most women were willing parties too, and that a 2,000 year old book of moral tales can hold a massive amount of power when deliberately abused in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>It's also highly commendable that the cast are just 'normal folk', no super skinnies, models, hunks or pretty boys are in sight. This makes it all the more believable, it could happen to you and me. The lead, 'Offred' (Elizabeth Moss) absolutely nails it. No spoilers, but she will impress you with her canny nouse and determination to survive despite many obstacles and traps. I haven't seen one bad actor in here so far, they've obviously got bags of talent and emotional range. The design and resurrection of 'The Shaker Movement', as in the book, harks back to an American and European age of persecution and religious fervor. <br/><br/>Adhering to Maggie's descriptions of the colour coded dress, the production designer's subtle placement of now highly valuable Shaker furniture here and there helps; the muted drab colours, even in the opulent wealthy homes, take us sub consciously back to the times of Salem, witch trials, mass hysteria and life devoid of 'modern vices' like free speech, self determination, free love and modern relationships.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see how this progress', although I know how it ends (can't tell you, but get ready for some shocks!).

I'm good at this stuff and the acting and characters blew me away that I wasn't looking for it. <br/><br/>Best Pilot ever. IMHO.<br/><br/>Then I thought. Well they can't do that every episode because if you are looking for twists you find them. If I was told there was a twist at the end, I would have figured it out (everyone's birthday on the same day, etc). But the fact one was black and the other two were twins threw me. PLUS the fact one was \"Ryan Gosling\" body and the other was overweight threw me that they were twins. Both played on stereotypes which I Loved they made us look into ourselves a little.<br/><br/>So where does the show go from here? It has a great premise. Dual time lines. You can do a lot with that. Have stories play out with flashbacks to tell a larger story (ala Lost). The casting was nailed with exceptional talent. I was interested in every character. They even nailed it by casting Simon and Simon vet Gerald McRaney. He was the glue that MADE that story line click. He speech on the chair was Emmy worthy. I hope he is a regular cast member and explore his wife's death and the death of his one child.<br/><br/>I'm hooked for at least season one. No need for twists. The dual time lines and great characters is enough for me. They can bounce all around in the 80s when the \"triplets\" are 4 or 10 or 15. triple time lines or more.

Such clever writing, acting and directing.<br/><br/>I have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched. Season 4 episodes Open Mic and The Olive Branch brought tears to my eyes. \"That\" scene in Olive Branch I have rewatched about a dozen times and will watch again and again. (Avoiding spoilers here so not saying more than that.)<br/><br/>David Rose. I just want to put my arms around him, give him a big hug, tell him he's beautiful and good and right and that everything will be okay.<br/><br/>Love, love, love Schitt's Creek. Love the humour, the satire, the subtle jokes and the big, fat broad ones, and most of all I love the love.

The script sometimes feels like it was written by a team of 15 year old girls. I'd say my biggest complaint, is how stupid its become. The logic has become mind numbingly dumb. Soooo many plot holes. Sooo many inconsistencies. In one episode, called \"Flash Time\", all the Flashes are running near the speed of light. Then, in other episodes, Flash slips on some marbles and goes \"Darn it, the bad guy got away because I fell down. There is no way I'd be able to catch up with them now!\" I've forgiven them alot over the years for using dumb logic in their plot devices, in all their episodes , but its become way too much. The writers don't even care anymore about making sense. They've relegated this show to pure stupidity. The crisis crossover has been the dumbest thing I've seen on TV. I mean seriously, in 1 scene, Barry must run on the treadmill to save the multiverse. I use to watch all the arrowverse shows, but I've dropped all of them but Flash, but soon I will be dropping flash. It's obvious their target demographic for this show are 10 yr old girls.

The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. <br/><br/>The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. <br/><br/>The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films.

I decided to write one, after seeing all the positive remarks on season 3, feeling quite the opposite myself.\nI really liked season 1 of \"Stranger Things\", one of the best shows I have ever watched. Season 2 was so-so for me, already seeing where things were going - protracting and adding almost nothing new to the previous one, it was worse.\nBut season 3 is really really bad. It is laughable, unrelatable, full of nonsense. It has almost nothing to do with the atmosphere of the show from season 1 (and to some extend season 2). It is different in every way, and not in a good way. After the first two episodes I was already questioning myself whether or not to finish watching it till the end. The next episodes I watched with one eye looking at other things on my phone, skipping entire scenes of \"important\" dialogue. I actually did not watch the very end of the last episode, I just stopped it.\nWhy did we like \"Stranger Things\" in the first place? Maybe because of the dark atmosphere, the story about the secret experiments and telekinesis, the monster and the upside-down. This is what I believe most people liked. If there was a good writing, I think next seasons should've explained more and more about these things: what is the nature of the monster, why did it appear, what did it want, what was the upside-down all about?\nWhat do we have in Season 3 instead? New corny light atmosphere, some kind of a new monster created out of thin air, unexplained actions and decisions by some people somewhere, new characters appearing with the snap of your finger, just because..., and no answers whatsoever to the important questions of the original story that got us hooked.\nThe two most annoying things here were the shift from the original story to the one about the life of the kids, and the inclusion of the mighty bad Russians.\nRegarding the first one, the show simply changed its story (I guess either because the creators/Netflix were out of ideas, or they wanted to prolong, of course, their \"product\" for as many seasons as possible). Now we were introduced to hours and hours of show about \"a day in the life of ...put a name here...\". I get it, the kids grow up, become teenagers, they start to develop feelings for each other, blah blah blah...But this was not what Stranger Things was about in the first place! And even there, there was no story development at all. Instead, we shifted scenes from one couple, to the next one, then to the next one, and then back again. They say couple of sentences to each other, and we move on. Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat...\nThe second annoying thing was maybe the most laughable and unbelievable of them all - the introduction of the big bad Russians. They just simply appeared out of nowhere, knowing almost all about the experiments, the door to the other world, maybe the monster (how, what did they want, why were they doing it, these are stupid questions nobody cares about, right?). They had unlimited resources, operated without notice on American soil (WTF, HAHAHAHAHA), had amazing technology and machines (??). And then the Russian \"Schwarzenegger\" guy? Oh, my lord, that was absolutely ridiculous, and absolutely unrealistic. The scene where he walks around hundreds of people celebrating 4th of July with dark military clothes and holding gun in his hand (!!!) just like that, then he shoots a guy dead, but guess what, people around him do not notice, they have balloons and candy and smiles on their faces. Utter nonsense! Or when the \"conspiracy\" US guy was able to fool one Russian guard with his bad Russian accent????? What a joke!\nAt that point I honestly thought Stanger Things moved to the genre of parody. The whole Russian thing reminded me very much of the ridiculously unrealistic old James Bond movies from the 70s-80s. You always had some villain with a base on the moon/island/snow/underground, with unlimited resources, hundreds of people operating under his command, pushing buttons in some corridors in some rooms in some chairs. And our guys are just 3 or 4 against hundreds...\nAnd by way, being Eastern European myself, the image and acting of all the Russians was unrealistic and bad, they don't act and sound and say things the way the show portrayed them, to be honest.\nAnyway, to end this, watching Season 3 of this once great and very promising show was a complete waste of time and grey matter. I will not watch anything new that will come in the future about Stranger Things.\nFor me this show started and ended at season 1.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "11 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "7 July 2019"}, {"title": " Season 3, meh", "content": "Season 1 and 2 were fantastic.

Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things. <br/><br/>Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered. <br/><br/>The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable. <br/><br/>Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. <br/><br/>Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). <br/><br/>I loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. <br/><br/>From the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.<br/><br/>I know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce.

A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.<br/><br/>It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.<br/><br/>What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.<br/><br/>Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.<br/><br/>It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. I cannot recommend this show enough.

The postmodern comedy  for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested  Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and  satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy.  Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style  show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too  hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.

The cast is perfect, the script is clever and very funny and the addition of the \"documentary feel\" adds a whole lot to the tongue in cheek humour. There's a lot to say about why this show is great and for me it's for a great part about Ty Burell and Ed O'Neill. The latter, ofcourse, is almost a culthero because of his role in Married with Children, but in MF he's just amazing. His agitated looks into the camera are spot-on and his fear of Gloria is played out great. Burell, in his own right, is a class apart. I wonder if his role could have written in the way is has been written, if it hadn't been played by him. Take away the physical element and his sarcastic undertone and you might end up with an annoying character that insults his wife on a regular base and is constantly dodging responsibility. But this show is about a group and not a lead and everything works. The gayjokes, the sarcasm, the familyfeel... I love it. But...<br/><br/>Somewhere it loses its magic. Not all the children grow up fine in the show. Manny gets annoying, little Joe could have been left out and Haley starts working in my nerves. But I guess this is always a big risk when working with young actors who have to keep playing their chosen role. Also, somewhere around season 7 or 8, the script loses its touch and this is showing in season 9: weird plots, overacting and more crudeness erode the original feel.<br/><br/>And please Hollywood... stop botoxing, lipfilling and plastic surging your actors.

I know that you can't be 100% true-to-life realistic in a show, that fiction is always present.<br/><br/>But I think they overdid it with New Amsterdam.

If you're persistent enough and believe it hard enough, everything will be just fine. There are no sad moments, and if one slips in, it doesn't last too long - good vibes only! Everything always has a closure. Flings aside, every workplace is super healthy and there is no envy or jealousy. Everybody plays along well with each other and nobody tries to sabotage you, make you fail or seek an opportunity to replace you and your well-paid position.

There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.<br/><br/>\"go to your happy place\" \"what is that? that sounds stupid.\"<br/><br/>There's also the expressionless, unreadable openly gay police captain who is anything but a gay stereotype, the sociopathically manipulative secretary who in her own words \"thrives on dysfunctional relationships\", and detective scully who is in every sense of the word a failure, smelly, lazy, unadept and just all around a horrible police officer. Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. <br/><br/>Overall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

While successful police dramas have ruled the airwaves for decades, the same cannot be said for cop shows that aim for laughs. There are some noticeable exceptions such as \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and the very short-lived \"Police Squad\", but for the most part, it has been hard for show-runners to make crime a funny topic on TV. \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" could have ended up being super broad like \"Police Academy: The Series\" or \"Reno 911\", but luckily creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur have made the decision to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality, allowing for viewers to relate to the characters without them becoming complete cartoons. In casting Andy Samberg as the lead, there was the risk of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" coming across too goofy. However, Samberg is at his career best here as Jake Peralta, a childish and immature detective who just happens to be very good at his profession. Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.<br/><br/>If \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.<br/><br/>Although there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10", "rating": null, "helpful": "102 out of 146 found this helpful.", "date": "9 January 2014"}, {"title": " Noice!", "content": "My all-time favorite TV series!

The star detective (played by Samberg) winningly carries the lead with charm (if not grace), but as part of a true ensemble cast, carefully crafted iconic roles played well, and all won me over in the first episode. The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! <br/><br/>The producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest. I watched the pilot more out of curiosity (and Samberg fan-girl-ing) then out of any hope I would add this to my roster, but wonder of wonders, this thing actually works! Creative and original \"detective\" comedy - I'll be watching.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to BOTH people who can't stand cop/detective shows and just want to look down their nose whilst laughing at them, AND to people who love cop/detective shows, so they can learn just how stereotypical, clich\u00e9 and canned their favorites are.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "104 out of 155 found this helpful.", "date": "19 September 2013"}, {"title": " A surprisingly pleasant, silly yet witty show.", "content": "After first hearing about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I was fairly skeptical about yet another attempt on Fox's part to regain their former position as king of network comedy, however; minutes after it had started, I was able to find an affection for this show that I haven't had for a comedy pilot since The Office.<br/><br/>Anchored in large part by Andy Samberg's ironic sense of humor, it also features plenty of dead-pan humor and caricatures, much of it being a parody of the typical crime drama.<br/><br/>Half-way through, I realized it felt fairly reminiscent of The Office's early days, unbeknownst to me that was intended to channel that style and humor, despite it not being a mockumentary.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt it to be one of the strongest pilots for a comedy I had seen in a while. They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.<br/><br/>There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.<br/><br/>I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.<br/><br/>People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.<br/><br/>Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.<br/><br/>In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clich\u00e9s of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "111 out of 168 found this helpful.", "date": "19 September 2013"}, {"title": " Shows a lot of promise - a very likable new sitcom.", "content": "I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.<br/><br/>I find this review odd, because \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" - if nothing else - comes across as a very likable show. <br/><br/>Thankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \"cop show\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.<br/><br/>The cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \"star\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \"Parks and Recreation,\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise.

Not so much.<br/><br/>This is a crime show in a period where crime shows are all the rage, so the formula is a familiar one: a crime - usually, but not always, murder - is discovered at the beginning of the show, and the cast are the people who solve the crime. The main difference is that these crimes take place in the military, so the crime solvers aren't detectives, but agents. Leading our intrepid pack is Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), \"the best agent ever,\" according to director, Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly). The rest of the team consists of Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Wetherley), whose last name fittingly rhymes with \"Bozo,\" Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who seems to perpetually be the unrespected \"probie,\" and Agent Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), who died at the end of season 2, and was replaced by Israeli Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who, despite having been in the USA for many years, still doesn't seem to get American cultural references. They are assisted by Dr. Donald Mallard (David McCollum), incongruously called \"Ducky,\" and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), arguably the brains of the outfit, although her area of expertise is never specified. Somehow this rather offbeat and bumbling combination manages to solve the crime every week, and successfully sees that the guilty party faces the proper authorities.<br/><br/>The writing of this show is an odd mixture in that they do manage to come up with some intriguing scenarios, but have created some of the most unlikable characters I've ever encountered.

DiNozzo takes cluelessness to levels that really ought to get him thrown out of the Navy. Ziva covers her inability to get American culture with an attitude of superiority that is wearing. Ducky is a little too eager to describe the results of his autopsies in gory detail - with visual aids. And Abby really leaves me wondering how she manages to exist outside the confines of an institution. The only one I find to be both smart and likable is McGee, and nobody listens to him. Their efforts to solve crimes often come across as bumbling as the Keystone cops, and I'm left wondering how this is supposed to be representative of the Navy's finest.<br/><br/>Given that the characterizations are so unpleasant, it's hard to know how much of that is the fault of the writing, and how much of the actors themselves. Since the characterizations are so consistent from week to week (perhaps a little too consistent, since in some cases they show no growth at all), I'm inclined to say that the actors are doing a good job with limited material. Frankly, they could all benefit from a chance to stretch a bit with their characters, and I think they're all easily up to the challenge.<br/><br/>While I think the idea of showing us how the Navy deals with crimes that take place among its members is a good premise, I really don't care for the artistic choices made in bringing this show to life. In short, these aren't people that I want to invest an hour of my time watching, and the only way I'd ever enjoy the show is if somebody hit Gibbs upside the back of the head - repeatedly. Still, clearly, I'm in the minority, and it looks like this \"delightfully dysfunctional family\" will be around for awhile solving crimes and entertaining the masses.

Almost everything about this show is cheesy, lame, repetitive and poorly thought out. The dialog is sub par at best. It seems like everyone likes the characters and I have not the slightest idea why. The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability. So I guess I will continue tuning in because I am forced to... I wonder what the story will be next time? My money says that, wait let me guess, a member of the navy.... is murdered!!!!!

Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today.

However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.<br/><br/>We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:<br/><br/>Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: <br/><br/>Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:<br/><br/>It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: <br/><br/>Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.

(I went to Martial arts school years and years ago and was able to see a lady from China who demonstrated her martial arts for us and it was incredible quality, amazing flips control and finesse, this show has none of that. At a U. S. open martial arts tournament I saw the actors of the original Teenage mutant turtles. Hoyoung Pak etc. They were unbelievable absolutely amazing outside the heavy suits).

I am a die hard Superhero &amp; martial arts fan, but most CW stuff is just there to fill the void after all else is watched. The CW loses valuable supporting actors in shows ( like Supergirl's Jeremy Jordan, that help the shows tremendously and leave the most mediocre actors or just poorly directed/written/produced , they can't discern talent or those hired to run them are just that bad. This is like almost all of CW and it's Superheroes etc., low budget versions of Marvel and better tv. Such a shame since my first love of Superheroes came from things like the old Justice League cartoons.<br/><br/>I wish someone who makes decisions would seek out and take criticism and improve the CW. I personally think the best they have right now is Titans and some good actors scattered in different shows.

Investigators DCI Cassie Stuart and DS Sunil 'Sunny' Khan are initially unsure if the case is worth investigating as they have no idea how old the body is and no obvious way of identifying it. The only clue is a rusting car key\u0085 amazingly this leads to the car which leads to the identity of the victim and a book containing a list of names. The body belonged to a young black man who went missing in the seventies and the names belong to a variety of people; all of whose lives are about to be thrown into turmoil along with the lives of those around them.<br/><br/>These include an Anglican priest who'd had a relationship with a fifteen year old girl, a woman who is now married to a black man but was a member of a racist group in the seventies, a man about to be given a peerage who was an enforcer for a London gang and a disabled man whose wife is suffering from dementia. Over the course of the series the police find possible motives for each of the person on the list and as they investigate dark secrets emerge; even those who are innocent of this crime have other long-held secrets which emerge; some of them will find redemption but some lives will be destroyed forever.<br/><br/>Murder mysteries are one of the staples of television; even ones involving cold cases are hardly new but 'Unforgotten' manages to bring something new to the genre. While there is the question of who killed the body in the basement that isn't the only thing of interest\u0085 in fact the other secrets that emerge are just as interesting. Given that the original crime took place in the seventies it isn't surprising that much of the main cast in is quite a bit older than one finds in most programmes. The cast does a great job; Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar impress as the two leading police officers, it was refreshing to have cops who just get on with the job rather than having their own personal issues. Those playing the suspects and their families were fine too; most notably Trevor Eve, as the ex-gangster and Tom Courtenay and Gemma Jones who played the disabled man and his senile wife although it seems unfair to only pick out a few as the cast was uniformly good.

To begin with, I find this an amazing series, very well played by the actors. The series, in my opinion, lets see how the influence of the past throws the shadow over the present, even for old people... It's a story of a so called cold case team. I wondered how it is in England, I am from Netherlands, at some time, 18 years, the crime is \"verjaard\" here. I think it is called \"limitation\" in UK. So no persecution is possible. So I was surprised to see arrests... But that is not the point, all people somehow involved in the victim's life see their present life disrupted, they have tried to put their involvement to the back of their minds, but that never had success, and now the police come to rattle it up... Its also about change, can you really change from skinhead to tolerant? Are you really different from the person yo were 40 years ago? The main question from the detective is also crucial, \"should I do it or shouldn't I?\" Its 40 years ago, let it go, no!, \"I want to solve the case and punish the perpetrator\". Heartbreaking is the confrontation between detective and mother of the victim.<br/><br/>Now the racists aspects. It is a well known fact that in the 70ties gay bashing was not unknown and hatred against \"coloured\" people also existed. So not a strange move to keep that possibility open in the investigation. In fact there are a lot of references at racism, the boy who gets angry at his protector, who means well, the victim being \"chocolate\", the husband who protects his wife even after he knows the facts of her former life... So, Patherton, why on earth should one go counting who is white and who is black in a series? And who is bad and who is not? That says something about you, doesn't it?<br/><br/>According to Patherton: 1/ Detective is female, what a political correct fact! 2/ Assistant is Indian, another one! So we have now a female detective with an Indian assistant and they go along very well, well, that's enlightening... 3/ All the bad men were white! What a joke, It just happened to be so. If you ever watch American series, all black kids are in gangs and all are involved with weapons and drugs. No, not this series. 4/ A woman who marries a black man and helps a black kid with his chemistry exam, is also political correct? Maybe she really regretted the phase of her former life, being member of National front? And whats wrong with political correct? What is political correct anyway? Had the series been better if there was a black murderer? If so obviously Patherton has no idea about the intentions of the series...<br/><br/>So, go see this, its a very good series that make you think... Very clever and emotional filmmaking.<br/><br/>At the moment I am watching season 2 and that is as good as season one. In the beginning we see stories of people of which we ask ourselves, who are they? and what is this? As the series goes on we see all the stories are entangled with the story of the victim. Fascinating stuff! Again, solving a murder that happened a long time ago, does involve different kind of people. And again some aspects of today's society are mentioned. Like the woman with the headscarf who likes to be the school headmaster, or 2 men who live together and like to be father of an adopted girl...

The subtle difference between \"reproducing\" Star Wars and \"recapturing\" Star Wars. Why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right", "content": "It's one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.<br/><br/>Like with \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (2018)\" and their comicbook-industry experts participation, the creators behind The Mandalorian were experts of the industry, connoisseurs of the Star Wars Universe and even long time fans. So they were able to not only recapture the aesthetic of the grimy, battered Star Wars but also build upon it taking the most \"subtle\" things into account. Things like the predominancy of puppets and practical effects over CGI, settings you can feel and touch over green screens and the abundancy of not only known elements previously seen in Star Wars, but a whole batch of new creatures, designs and overall plot elements that felt like they belong to this universe and had always been there.<br/><br/>Exceeding expectations are not only the visual aspects but the narrative too. It might be too late for some story elements now, but it is of great importance that from now on you try to watch the unraveling of the story unspoiled. I was lucky to have seen the premiere of the show before the \"memefication\" of a certain \"element\" that went viral and became one of the biggest highlights of the show. But for me I saw the reveal of this element unspoiled and I was pleasantly shocked, a memory I'll always carry with me. The ability of these creators to generate such shock value and deep moments it's often baffling to me. This is proof that the creators behind the narrative are fully aware of the complexities of the universe they are tampering with and like an experienced surgeon, they are able to tweak, traverse and call back any Star Wars element as they please and with astonishing results.<br/><br/>It seems to be obvious that series creator Jon Favreau turns to gold everything he touches, from his influence in the MCU with the first Iron Man (2008) movie (still regarded today as a favorite among the infinite Marvel movies) to the remarkable and commercially successful live-action Jungle Book and Lion King Disney movies. He seems to understand how to treat a franchise not by exploiting the nostalgia aspects but rather use them to fuel new stories and \"revive\" the experience. Not to mention the contributors to this amazing show hype up the expectations and the quality of the show, from beloved names like Taika Watiti to legendary Star Wars showrunner Dave Filoni. The show today is in the most capable hands possible and away from the corporate meddling of Kathleen Kennedy.<br/><br/>Despite everything it does right, I have found some things that distanced me from it. It is merely one small and almost inevitable aspect I don't think a huge lore such as Star Wars can escape from. Something that makes the world-building so real: the subtle callbacks and references found on names and other elements. This is an aspect that non-Star Wars Lore fans (in which I have to identify myself as even though I have read and know some of the deeper lore) will not like or get as they are cast aside for not picking up or straight up know these references. If people don't know what a Gungan is they won't get the \"you are as ugly as a Gungan\" joke, for instance. But as for the rest, the story can be followed and understood because it feels self-contained and you don't need to know much about the SW status quo at the time other than (in simplified terms) an Empire ruled over the galaxy and now it's over, in this world there are mercenaries that adhere to a code among themselves, there's a magical energy flowing through all of us called The Force, there's a group of Force-wielding knights that fight with light swords, and that's about it. Anything else you need to know it is presented in the story or explained through exposition, which in a huge universe that is Star Wars it is a must in order to be able to tell a story worthy of SW.<br/><br/>\nAs for the show itself, these are some of the most predominant reasons why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right (reasons I believe stand out among many others the show has) -- WARNING: MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD OF SEASON 1:<br/><br/><ul><li>The treatment of the Force -- long gone were the days when the Force had nothing new to teach us. It seemed we have seen it all and had witness it being reduced to a \"superpower\" the Jedis use to move objects. But perhaps the biggest aspect that seemed to bring controversy is the treatment of the force as this quantifiable and immutable force presented in the Prequels. However, the most successful Star Wars stories have not treated it as such, despite the fact that this new addition was provided by its own creator, George Lucas; in fact, the most successful Star Wars stories have expanded on the capabilities of the force still considering it a mystifying and intangible energy that lives in all of us and the binds the universe together. The Mandalorian takes place post Empire, which means the force has started to be known across the galaxy thanks to the Legend of Luke Skywalker, auguring the return of the Jedi Knights. Therefore, treating the force used by the so-called \"baby yoda\" as a powerful and non-understanding power but in fact recognised by some who have heard of it is a genius move as it makes it magical and uncharted still, a long lost ethereal power that exists beyond our comprehension. The force should be something we don't fully understand yet nor people in universe will fully understand either. By allowing the force to be pure and uncharted, there's room for more creative uses of it that when done right can provide of elevated moments. This are shown especially on episodes 7 and 8 of season 1 where by using terms like \"a group of sorcerers called Jedi\", \"I have heard of this power\" and \"i have seen him move things with its mind\" makes the force more mystified and bewildering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The puppets -- say whatever you want about the incredible alien, prop and set designs of other Star Wars main stream media (TV shows, video games, movies with some really good exceptions of course) but I am one to believe that generally the main reason why none of the later Star Wars media released after the OT were really embraced by everyone as part of the universe is because the \"feel\" of the world we were seeing was not the same. Star Wars stood out from sci-fi like Star Trek and other more \"clean and smooth\" worlds by building a grimy, run-down and almost post-apocalyptic set and prop design with a huge contrast of advanced technology. So when The Mandalorian brought it back, not only by imitating the set and character designs and such but by expanding upon those by using new imagery and creating new alien species that fit with that new world, it was a display of world-understanding beyond any new incorporations Abrams, Johnson and even good ol' George Lucas had ever brought post-OT. By bringing back puppets and practical effects and make up it shows and it gives you the satisfaction of knowing in 30 years it will still hold up because they are physical things, tangible by the actors and even though \"baby yoda\" moves and when grabbed looks like a sack of potatoes, you don't mind because you know it exists, it is there, you can hold it. I'll take your fully-functioning puppet over the best CGI because truth is, in some years, the CGI will have improved so much you'll start to see the cracks when looking back.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematic Special Effects for a TV show -- this may be known for those who keep up with Star Wars news or watch the Mandalorian documentaries in Disney+, but the innovative tech used for the background and other special effects is almost revolutionary and provides a high quality that resembles that of a cinematic film. Needless to say, the special effects, real-model sets design and other props allows the universe to exist and be tangible instead of rendering a scene that with tim we'll notice it doesn't really exist</li></ul><br/><br/>END OF SPOILERY STUFF --<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, The Mandalorian is a worthy sequel to the OT, maintaining the same aesthetic, themes and recognisable elements but providing new and incredible ideas that amount to the incredible universe that is Star Wars. If they are able to keep it up it'll become one of the best SW media to come in its history. Disney Star Wars seems to know what it's doing now after stumbling a couple of time and I commend them for it. SW isn't an easy franchise to expand and continue despite the amount of stories that are left to be told. You know the saying \"Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans\".

You're going to give a show that you supposedly loved 1 star just because you didn't like the last 4 minutes? God forbid a show actually make you use your brain to get answer instead of spoon-feeding it to everyone. Please do yourself a favor and google \"sopranos ending explained\" and read the first article, it's long but you'll appreciate the show much more. Showing Tony actually getting whacked would have been tasteless, boring, and wouldn't have left us with anything to talk about. If you really pay attention and look at the fine details everything is there. Plus we had already seen Tony get shot on several occasions, and the fact that people spent 6 seasons cheering the guy on and then want to see the series end with him bleeding out on the table in front of his whole family. Some things are better left to the imagination, and when you put all the pieces together it's really pretty amazing what David Chase pulled off.<br/><br/>For anyone that thinks Tony's fate is up for debate, it's not. Some people say that it just meant that he was going to be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life (wrong). For starters, the finale opens with a shot of Tony asleep in bed and is supposed to resemble him dead in a coffin (and there is churchy sounding organ music playing). Then one of the few flashbacks in the episode is Bobby telling Tony \"you probably don't even hear it when it happens.\" Those are just a few hints out of many.<br/><br/>More importantly, the entire final scene was set up from Tony's point of view. It opens with him walking into the diner, they show him, they show the table where he will be sitting, then they cut back to Tony, and then there is a jump cut back to him sitting at the table. It's a strange looking cut, but it makes it appear that Tony is looking at himself (like an out of body experience).<br/><br/>During the final scene, you hear the bell ring 4 or 5 times, each time it cuts to Tony's face, then shows the doorway to the restaurant, and then cuts back for Tony's reaction. They use the bell to create a Pavlov's dog type effect, it makes you expect to see certain things each time the bell rings (shot of tony looking up, followed by a shot of what he sees from his POV). So the last time you hear the bell ring, you see Tony's face, and based on the established pattern the next thing should be what Tony is seeing (Meadow walking into the restaurant). But instead there is a smash cut to black, why? Because Tony is dead and you are seeing his point of view, he is no longer seeing or hearing anything. Chase wanted to do 30 seconds of black originally, and if it had just been the end they would have faded out the music instead of stopping it immediately. So You know that he got shot in front of his entire family, Meadow walked in at the last minute and witnessed it too. Carmella and AJ were looking at their menus and wouldn't have had a chance to warn Tony. And if Meadow hadn't been late then the shooter wouldn't have had a clean shot. To me that has much more of an impact than seeing him bleeding all over the table. The guy in the Members Only jacket going to the bathroom to get the gun was a throwback to the Godfather when Michael Corleone went to get the gun from the restaurant bathroom. They show each of them eating one of the onion rings that Tony ordered, which is supposed to symbolize taking communion. Tony had done too much messed up stuff to get off scott-free, and everyone knows that in the mob you either die or go to jail. <br/><br/>Whether you understood the ending or not, The Sopranos is one of the best TV series of all-time. It's a show with so much depth and complexity that you can watch it over and over and still find new stuff every time. If you only watch a few episodes here and there and then just watch the finale, you'll probably be disappointed like all the other idiots that did that were.

It's one third of what I like to call the \"holy trinity\" of TV dramas, the other two being the much loved Breaking Bad and the critically acclaimed The Wire. It's such a great TV series that even a 20,000 word review would struggle to explain every single thing about the show that works, and I know you're about as willing to read a post that long as I am willing to write one, so I'll try not to draw this one out too much. That being said, there's a lot about this show that I want to say, and a lot of praise I'd love to throw its way, so here goes.<br/><br/>The Sopranos works on so many different levels it's staggering. It's a complex character study, a tense crime drama, a relatable family drama, and sometimes it even feels like a weird, twisted sitcom. There's moments of brutal and shocking realism right alongside surreal dream sequences and scenes ambiguous in nature. There's suspense, black comedy, surprising deaths, and even the odd tear-jerking moment.<br/><br/>Every character is fascinating, as barely anyone is purely good or purely evil- almost every character is a different shade of morally ambiguous grey, and this is what makes almost every character, major or minor, so interesting. The stand-out character of course is Tony Soprano; the show is about him after all. He is absolutely flawlessly played by James Gandolfini, who has done other stuff in his career, but never anything as memorable as his role as the lead in The Sopranos. Here is a character who feels like such a real person it's damn near scary- I feel like I know Tony better than some people I see in real life on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This is perhaps one of the most fleshed-out and well-developed characters in the history of entertainment. Throughout the 6 seasons we see dozens of Tony's therapy sessions, with each one adding something to the character. We see many of his dreams too, with these sequences putting the viewer directly into his head and allowing us to see his most personal thoughts and feelings. He interacts with countless other characters too; in fact, almost every character in the show interacts with Tony on at least one occasion. It's a credit to both Gandolfini and the writers that the character of Tony Soprano felt so real throughout the show's run.<br/><br/>That's not to say Tony's the only well-developed character on the show, because that's not true at all. Almost every character has depth and is interesting in their own way- personal favourite characters of mine include Livia Soprano, Tony's delightfully crabby mother who's obsessed with control, Ralph Cifaretto, an absolutely horrible colleague of Tony's who is so much fun to despise, and Adrianna, a character who starts out as being there mainly for fan service, but becomes one of the show's most sympathetic and interesting characters further down the line. I would like to talk more about the characters, but honestly, to do so may cause this review to move into spoiler territory, because like I said before, nobody on this show is ever really safe from death. One character may appear to be the kind of person who'd last all six seasons, but may well be \"whacked\" after just a few episodes. On the other hand, there's characters who could only be seen in the background occasionally throughout the first season who become significant characters in later seasons. What I'm trying to get at is that the show's unpredictable and I don't want to go into discussing specific plot-lines or characters too much because you're really better off going into this series knowing as little as possible in order to get the most enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>And by the way, try not to read too much about the show on the internet either before or while you're watching it, as it's an old-ish show, and that means people are generally less cautious about displaying spoiler warnings prior to discussing potentially \"sensitive\" material. The internet is a dangerous place to be while you're watching a show that's already aired, so just remember to be cautious.<br/><br/>The use of music in this show is also something that really needs mentioning. The show uses music frequently, and also uses a great range of music throughout its run. David Chase and the others who worked on the show clearly have a talent for selecting music that just works so well for particular moments. Special mention has to go to a few songs/scenes in particular:\n<ul><li>Alabama 3's \"Woke up This Morning,\" which is used so perfectly in the show's unforgettable opening sequence, which never fails to get me psyched for the episode to follow.</li><li>A lesser-known Rolling Stones song called \"Thru and Thru\" is used unbelievably well in the final montage of seasons 2's finale, \"Fun-house.\" (\"Fun\" fact: Funhouse is not only my favourite episode of The Sopranos but probably my favourite TV episode of all time. I think it's so good I might even write a blog post specifically for the episode, as I can't really go into why it's so good in this review without outlining the general plot-line).</li><li>Then there's the song \"Wrapped in my Memory\" by Shawn Smith used at the end of the classic episode \"Long-term Parking,\" which is season 5's penultimate episode. The way this bittersweet sounding song is used is phenomenal- a perfect way to end one of the most well-known episodes of the show</li><li>And I don't want to forget the use of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" in the show's notorious final scene. Most people seem to associate the song with Glee, but The Sopranos used it first, and so much better too. Like the episode Funhouse, the final scene of The Sopranos could use its own blog post also, but I probably won't ever talk about it because it's already been discussed to death all over the internet. Generally every episode of The Sopranos ends with a piece of music that plays over the final scene, and continues to play over the credits, and it's staggering how often this piece of music reflects either the style, tone, themes, or even the general plot of the episode it closes. I'm an absolute sucker for a good soundtrack, and The Sopranos, I'm pleased to say, completely nails it in the music department.</li></ul><br/><br/>The writing and the directing in The Sopranos is sharp as hell too. The writer's inject so much wit, tension, and pathos into this show (sometimes all at once) it's mind-blowing. The show has so many different moods and feelings, but somehow the writers manage to tie it altogether into something that feels very cohesive. Many, many quotable lines and catchphrases too. This show has some serious style too, and the look and feel of the show honestly looks almost movie-quality at times. This can be credited to the show's directors and cinematographers, who give the show such a unique and memorable style that really progresses and becomes more pronounced as the show goes on. There's a reason this show was so revolutionary and acclaimed when it first came out- no other show before it had ever looked quite so cinematic. I personally found myself forgetting at times that I was watching a TV show (worth mentioning is that the acting from some cast members is movie-quality too).<br/><br/>Mind you, The Sopranos is not a show for everyone. It's got some very adult content, and there's the fact that it's quite a strange show too- there's literally at least three episodes that are almost 45 minute long dream sequences inside Tony's head, and a sense of ambiguity is often present thanks to the characters' general sense of moral murkiness, as well as their often strange and ambiguous motivations that aren't always spelled out. Almost no character is ever easy to decipher and understand- there's few stereotypes on this show- and while this could frustrate some people, I personally like this aspect of the show, as it makes everyone feel a bit more \"real\" and compelling. And then there's that ending, which isn't going to be for everyone (I loved it though).<br/><br/>I also want to say that this show requires some patience to really get into. I don't think the first season was phenomenal, as the writers and cast members were still trying to work out the best way to portray and develop these characters, so it gets off to a slightly shaky and uncertain start. Mind you, I still thought the first season was very good, but it took me to the end of the second season before I started loving the show, and it was about a month after I finished the final season before I realised that The Sopranos was probably my all-time favourite show. The show will grow on you, but it'll probably take some time, so be patient. Pretty much every HBO show is like this (see Game of Thrones and The Wire in particular). Also, there are a huge number of characters, and it will take by my approximation at least 10 episodes before you'll remember most of their names (unless you've got a great memory or something). This can make early episodes a little difficult to get through, but if you stick with it it'll become something you get used to.<br/><br/>So if you're an avid TV watcher, I highly recommend giving The Sopranos a watch. It helped popularise the sense of grey VS grey morality that is so prevalent many recent shows, and also pushed many boundaries in regards to what kind of adult content a TV show could depict, as well as how cinematic TV could look. It's amazingly well acted, written, and directed, has an astoundingly diverse soundtrack, and features in my personal opinion one of the most deep and interesting characters off all-time- Tony Soprano. I see it as required viewing, and even though you personally may not love every aspect of it, I'm sure most of you will be at least able to develop a great sense of respect for the show. Don't be put off by its age, or the fact it ended 13 years ago- this is still must-watch television that has aged and will continue to age gracefully.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "31 out of 35 found this helpful.", "date": "23 April 2020"}, {"title": " Third time watch since the series ended.

I never underestimated this show, because I heard great stuff about it, but also bad stuff. And that's okay, because it is not a show for everyone. If you enjoy mafia movies, even on a small level, you are definitely going to enjoy this. If you don't enjoy mafia movies, then you're probably going to enjoy it anyway. The reason why I am comparing this to movies, is because it is a movie on some level. It is a cinematic show. Before The Sopranos, shows such as Friends, Seinfeld, etc, all shared the same thing. A 20 minute episode, they weren't necessarily connected to each other, but people still enjoyed them. Now The Sopranos, it has been said by many that it is basically a 13 hour movie. That is because each season has 13 episodes (except for the last one). I imagine what a challenge it must have been for David Chase (the creator) to get a television to pick the show up. Naturally, he got turned down. It would have been impossible for The Sopranos to be part of a network television. I believe that the limit in network tv, is about 42 minutes per episode (then you have the commercial breaks and other things). Luckily, HBO decided to put the show on the air. An episode is around 52-60 minutes, and it was this show, that put HBO on the map (later producing shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Westworld etc). When the first episode aired in 1999, it started a new age of television. The viewers were introduced with the concept of an anti-hero, being the protagonist of the show. This shocked a lot of people, because they were used to seeing bad guys in movies, then getting killed at the end. Having said this, The Sopranos was immediately revolutionary. I imagine how people felt when watching it, thinking \"a show about a bad guy\"? It was never done before... But after the first season, people realized that it was special, and the reason for that is because it was different, unique. The greatest thing about this show, except the story line and structure, I have to say that it is the casting. It is not one of those shows where the lead actors are good, and then the extras are there to just do the part. Every single person withing the shot, is so spot on. I have to give credit to David Chase, who I know pays a lot of attention to detail. It is crazy how you can't imagine other people playing those characters, and that is because no one could play them like the cast did. James Gandolfini's performance is probably the most powerful performance on TV. I have watched a lot of shows, and I have never seen such brilliant acting. I hate it when people compare his performance to Bryan Cranston's on Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong, it is also one of the best performances, but you have to know that if it wasn't for The Sopranos, there wouldn't be Breaking Bad, or Walter White for that matter. The Sopranos opened the doors for many shows, such as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, etc. The other great thing about the show is the writing. Every character has its own arc. You can see how they develop during the show. Except for the anti-hero concept, I think that it was also the first show to introduce character development. There's something about how the characters are written. Just the main idea of the show, the professional and personal life of a mobster, struggling with his work and family, is brilliant. It treats subjects like illness, the importance of it, loyalty, love, trust, hatred, death, and many others. You see characters change, evolve, you start to like them, you start to dislike them. It is the best written show to this day. It is dark, witty, cynical, and most importantly, addictive. David Chase decided to do what no other director did before. He showed violence, drugs, sex, and other elements that no one thought of putting in television. It pioneered cinematic television, it took mental illness seriously, it changed how we watch TV. I am not reviewing the episodes and story line, because I don't want to spoil this masterpiece, but I have to say one more thing... Whatever you're doing, stop!

Based on a typical mob story the Sopranos goes one step further (many steps infact) and not only provides probably the clearer social commentary on modern America but also delivers the most well written show in the history of Television. It serves as the profile of a man who-in his existential crisis- tries to understand humanity, violence and the meaning of true love. Tony Soprano is a ruthless mob boss but also an extremely loving husband. The whole show builds it's flawlessness and genius around that line: the violent monster and a wonderful human being. The Sopranos mastered the term of an anti-hero to a degree that cannot be surpassed. Obviously James Gandolfini's monumental perfomance is the strongest point of this show but everything work together so well that you can't just lay your eyes away.<br/><br/>The raw strengh of all this deeply affects the viewer, personally it changed the way I see things in a lot of ways. All the violence at times is extremely disturbing, the amoralism of the crime world has never been more believable and depraved. As I said, David Chase has mastered the term of the anti-hero. All these main characters are basically monsters, unethical violent killers but still so likeable, so believable and so trustable. Chase is trying to understand what a sociopath really is, involving psychology, and after one point the viewer starts to really understand the weight of these gangsters actions.

I've been so moved by another show, it is really groundbreaking.<br/><br/>And then there is James Gandolfini who gives probably on the most momumental perfomances on camera. He has such a unique, charismatic aura in every frame he is in he simply is masterful. He can amazingly infuse anger, confusion, depression, love all on that same frame without making it less believable or overacting. He bases his perfomance with his eyes, heis simply jaw dropping in every minute of this show.<br/><br/>Then you got all the luben side characters, who all are so unforgettable, you think you really know them from one point forward. Paulie, Silvio, Furio all are classic to the mob universe, true gems.<br/><br/>This deep bond with all the characters make every dark decision they take so much more painful, you really start to feel the rage, the guilt, the grief and the existential crisis the characters are going through.<br/><br/>But besides all the nihilism there is love. Family, friendship, forgiveness. All these values have never been stronger in Television. It truly is Family Redifined. The nuclear American family is under attack here, constant analyzing with supreme social commentary on post 9/11 crisis and much more. Under all the hate this family keeps going through, never stops to fight for something better and as we can see in the final shot of the show it was really about family. Love, forgiveness, trying to understand each other, the basic values of every family are being presented with uch realism and fairness.<br/><br/>Hope is what holds Tony Soprano together, what keeps every human going. It's not about mob and gangsters. It's real life on camera.<br/><br/>Finally, under all it's gruesomeness hides the most beatifully realistic portrait of America and a wonderful teacher. Because David Chase makes it clear he doesn't have any answers. But though all the issues he addresses he pushes the viewer to find his own meaning whatever that may be and if there is one.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "15 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "26 March 2020"}, {"title": " The best mob show ever made and played by one of the best", "content": "Everything about this show is amazing.

Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. <br/><br/>Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.<br/><br/>The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. <br/><br/>And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. <br/><br/>To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.<br/><br/>I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?<br/><br/>Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.<br/><br/>I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.<br/><br/>The acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world. <br/><br/>The humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through. <br/><br/>The music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).<br/><br/>Gilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.<br/><br/>Better Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status.

It's almost as entertaining and intense as Breaking Bad, but if I were to choose between gunfights and courtroom drama, I'd go with the first.
