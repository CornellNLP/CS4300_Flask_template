It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes  in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too.  The humor is universal.  I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced.  Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing.  Just like how a sitcom should be.

I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever.

The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of \'Friends\'. My guess is they\'ve never seen or paid attention to the show. It\'s easy to discard something because "everyone likes it" and be "unique", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you\'ll fall in love with it too.

Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.<br/><br/>Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.<br/><br/>This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.<br/><br/>We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood.

However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.<br/><br/>We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:<br/><br/>Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: <br/><br/>Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:<br/><br/>It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: <br/><br/>Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.<br/><br/>And that's my review.", 'review_helpful': '611 out of 864 found this helpful.', 'review_rating': '', 'review_date': '23 March 2004'}, ' All-Time Best Sitcom': {'review_content': "I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.<br/><br/>When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list.

There are no fart jokes, no clichÃ©s, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake.
