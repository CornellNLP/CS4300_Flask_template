They checked our table every three minutes or so and picked up empty plates or brought new tea quickly without bothering us. They speak very politely. One of the staffs (he might have been the owner) even opened the door, bowed, and greeted us when we left the restaurant. I've never experienced this level of customer service. This might be because there were only a few people eating at the restaurant when we were there. Even so, their effort to make their customers happy is excellent. This place is large and clean, and their foods were very good! I'll definitely come back.\"}, {'Tayla Rhine': 'This place was a wonderful food experience for my husband and I during our short vacation in New York.

Customer service was amazing as well! I highly recommend!!!'}, {'Zoe Johnson': 'Great customer service! Very clean, spacious. Amazing options for small servings (sharing options) or entrees!

Never seen a harder working restaurant/bar staff either to be honest, they come to you - so you never have to wait on them or struggle to get their attention. 5 stars all across the board for me.\"}]",

You can dine as a party of 1 or a party of many and the service is the same: Friendly, kind, wholesome, sweet, the list could go on.'},\n   {'Lloyd Kim': \"I got a soy sauce marinated crab, spicy beef soup and stirred spicy pork and they were all good. It's a casual dining place with traditional Korean dishes and servers were also nice enough to give us some free food.\"},\n   {'Kyle Lee': 'Great restaurant located in K-town.

Looking forward to returning'}],\n  '13': [{'Claire J': 'I am blown away by the quality of food and price. Utmost sushi roll and poke bowl you can get it with very reasonable price! I am upset that I found this place now than before!\\n\\nI made it delivered and still fresh and delicious than any other dine-in sushi roll. This made my lunch time extra extra fancy and full, can’t wait to try other food on the menu!'},\n   {'Halin Lee': '100% recommend. Definitely my favorite sushi place in the city. Their pork katsu and sushi roll are amazing. It is so delicious! Wanna try other menu :)'},\n   {'Kate Nguyen': 'It’s amazing, staffs are very friendly and helpful. The sushi rolls are fresh and katsu is very crunchy and tasty. I’ve been a customer for 3 years, never disappoint me. 10/10 recommended.'},\n   {'andrea castro': 'My favorite place in food gallery. Amazing sushi and amazing workers!! come here all the time and I’m always satisfied. I recommend the tuna/salmon roll for anyone wanting to try :) there’s also seating right outside!'},\n   {'Virginia Lloyd': 'This is my absolute fav sushi spot. The rolls are delicious and very filling and the owners are so nice - I’ve received hand written thank you notes from them a few times now. Also, if you login and order through their website directly, they’ll give you a free meal after you order 10 times.'}],\n  '12': [{'admin admin': 'soo gooddddd. If they made a vegan Naeng Myun, I would order it every single day.'},\n   {'Shama A.': 'Absolutely great chili ramen! I had the shrimp ramen with seafood base - it was delicious. Not too spicy but perfect. Also had the spring rolls which you cannot go wrong with. The best part was the lovely lady who was taking our order at the register. She was so incredibly sweet and accommodating. Because of COVID we sat outside in the outdoor dining area and an external worker assumed we were eating outside food and requested a receipt. I told him the food was from Noona and he would not believe me (I did not request an original receipt), so I quickly went inside to ask the same lady for a receipt and she - despite being busy taking other orders - without hesitation gave me a genuine concerning smile and printed out a receipt for me promptly. She was exceptional in her service and will definitely be back to support her business!'},\n   {'Al Stenson': 'The best Pho in New York City!! I am going there for 2 years.

Sometimes.\\n\\nBut rest is very good\\nI dont get kimchi from h-mart\\nI only get it from here.'},\n   {'cory buchanan': \"korean food at this location - great. It's so savory.

It’s my favorite place. Their service was so nice and attentive this time since I was one of only 2 tables in the restaurant. However, I was very disappointed with the food. It tasted good, but it was mostly just rice. There was only a couple pieces of beef, and not that many vegetables either. In the past, I’ve never been able to finish it, but this time I was still so hungry afterwards that I ate all the kimchi and radish to try and fill me up. I don’t know if I will come back again.'},\n   {'Edison Branch': 'I very much like their dishes and customer service, awesome area next to my residence. The cashiers are always very friendly.

One at Nvidia HQ in Santa Clara, CA.  That was the best.  Here the crispy waffle was stale but can't blame them.

We went to the Empire State Building and purchased their pictures. With all the excitement during lunch we forgot our pictures on the table.

Not only did she just put them aside but when we called to see if they were left there I gave her my email address and she emailed me copies of my pictures. It gets even better, she offered to drop them in the mail for us!!!! This has been by far one of the greatest experiences ever in NY. Not only was their food AMAZING but the service was ABOVE & BEYOND!'},\n   {'DMONEY168': \"Good tacos, good service, the Watermelon Margaritas were very refreshing and good tasting but were way too watered down. 2 Margaritas at $13 a pop and didn't feel a thing.\"},\n   {'Kelsey B': 'A must eat while you are here!
